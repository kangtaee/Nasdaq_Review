"Airport stocks are rarely brought to the attention of retail investors. Yet, they can be marvelous investments due to their one-of-a-kind features. In this article, we are looking at three airport stocks whose unique qualities position them well for a potential takeoff in 2023. Particularly, Mexico-based Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste ( NYSE: ASR ), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico ( NYSE: PAC ), and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte ( NYSE: OMAB ) have been experiencing improvements in their financials over the past several quarters following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their shares trading near all-time high levels after outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) in the past year, their unique traits and attractive valuations could imply further upside in 2023, even though analysts don't expect upside from these stocks (see below). What Makes Airport Stocks Attractive Investments? Airports are totally unique assets that come with multiple attractive and investor-friendly characteristics. Let's go through three of the most significant traits that benefit airport stocks. 1. High-Quality, Diversified Revenues One of the most attractive characteristics of airports is that they enjoy high-quality revenues via multiple sources. Firstly, airports sign multi-year leases with airlines. These leases are usually long-term agreements that can provide a steady and predictable source of cash flow for the airport. Further, airports generate cash flows from a variety of other sources, including concessions, parking, and real estate rentals. Airlines are usually big, reputable businesses. Most are publicly traded, with transparent financials, while airports are incredibly critical for them to operate. Therefore, airports have minimal risks when it comes to collecting their rightful fees. Additionally, whether it comes from collecting car parking revenues, rental income from businesses operating within the airport, or other fees, these are high-margin cash flows with minimal operating costs. Airports provide the space and overall infrastructure but don't actually go through the hassle of operating these businesses directly, which makes for a great business model. 2. Growing Travel Demand The COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on the travel industry between 2020 and 2021. However, demand for travel has been rebounding, resulting in a growing demand for vacation and commercial trips. Flights generated revenues of just $36.4 billion in the U.S. in 2020, a massive drop from their pre-pandemic figure of $108.4 billion in 2019. With demand for travel rebounding strongly, flights are expected to generate revenues of $130.9 billion in 2023 - a new all-time high. Additionally, revenues are expected to grow by a CAGR of 3% through 2027. This means that airports are likely to be negotiating more leases with airlines, organically benefiting from the industry's growth without additional efforts. 3. Limited Investable Opportunities Finally, airport stocks benefit from the fact that there are only a few investable opportunities in the space. This makes them highly-attractive assets. This comes in two forms. Firstly, most airports around the world are wholly or partly owned by governments. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Denver International Airport, for instance, are owned and operated by The City of Los Angeles and the City &amp; County of Denver, respectively. Thus, investors have no opportunity to invest in the bulk of the world's airports. Secondly, airports are highly regulated and have essentially no competition in their respective markets. It's not like a potential competitor can go and build an airport next to an existing one and compete. Besides, they require enormous capital expenditures to contrast. In any case, this is also another reason why investors have very limited options when it comes to gaining exposure to airports, which makes the existing publicly-traded stocks like ASR, PAC, and OMAB highly scarce and attractive assets. Takeaway: Why are These Airport Stocks Worth Considering? Besides the attractive characteristics attached to airport stocks, as just discussed, ASR, PAC, and OMAB have multiple charming features on their own, which makes them attractive investments worth considering. Firstly, they are the biggest publicly-traded companies in the space, with exposure to multiple assets. I mentioned that airports benefit from diversified cash flows; ASR, PAC, and OMAB, each own nine, 12, and 13 airports, respectively. Further, the companies have a consistent history of generating sustainable profits and returning capital to shareholders due to their multiples qualities, as mentioned earlier. OMAB stock financials The combination of growing profits which has resulted in share price gains and hefty dividends has resulted in ASR, PAC, and OMAB stocks recording total returns of 353.2%, 322.2%, and 181.6%, respectively, over the past decade. Regarding their dividends, it's worth noting that while ASR, PAC, and OMAB do not have consistent track records, they do tend to grow their payouts in line with their profits. Unless you really value consistency when it comes to dividend growth, they should still serve adequately when it comes to growing your income over time. Finally, despite their shares trading near all-time high levels, all three stocks appear to be quite attractively priced. Specifically, ASR, PAC, and OMAB are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 13.8x, 14.5x, and 16.4x, respectively. These multiples are below their historical averages. Regardless, I find these multiples very cheap, considering the positive qualities attached to airport stocks. Thus, I believe all three stocks have strong prospects to keep flying higher through 2023. Disclosure",1,호재

"""Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilized in multiple applications. From image recognition to healthcare, e-commerce to advertising to credit scoring and many other industries - all are making use of AI’s human-like capabilities. And with computing power continuously improving, it is set to get more prevalent over time. One recent example of its impact is ChatGPT ? the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched last November. The tool has quickly caught the public’s imagination with its ability to perform different tasks such as write articles, songs and even write code and its success has only highlighted how AI will keep on impacting our lives. Of course, with any fledgling industry, investors will get an opportunity to buy in and there are publicly traded companies basing their entire value proposition around AI. With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two AI-focused stocks that have the experts singing their praises. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices right now. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) The first AI stock we're looking at is SoundHound AI, a voice assisting specialist. Via speech, its voice AI platform enables consumers to interact with products. This is not some esoteric segment of the market we’re talking about. The company sees a huge TAM (total addressable market) of $160 billion ahead; by 2024, there are expected to be 8 billion voice assistants in use with 75 billion connected devices operating worldwide the following year. SoundHound has some big-name clients on its roster such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Stellantis and Vizio. SoundHound only became a public entity this year, entering the market via the SPAC route back in April. It has been a trial by fire, to say the least. The shares are down by 88% since the debut as SPACs went seriously out of favor in 2022’s bear. Nevertheless, despite worries about the company being able to withstand the tough macro conditions amidst continued losses, it has been posting some impressive growth. In Q3, revenue climbed by 178% YoY to $11.2 million. The company saw a cumulative bookings backlog of $302 million, amounting to a 239% YoY increase - representing a fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth and a company record. In November, the company introduced a new product called Dynamic Interaction, a conversational AI tool that enables businesses to use voice AI technology when servicing customers. Cantor’s Brett Knoblauch thinks it could be a “game-changing technology as it pertains to how humans interact with computers, and more broadly speaking, technology.” “We believe there are numerous use-cases that this technology could be utilized for, with low-hanging fruit being within customer-service settings like restaurants,” the analyst went on to add. “We believe this product 1) further expands upon SOUN's conversational AI advantage; 2) gives us greater visibility into SOUN's revenue trajectory; 3) will accelerate the mix-shift of revenue towards subscription revenue; and 4) expands SOUN's addressable market.” Conveying his confidence, Knoblauch rates SOUN as Overweight (i.e., Buy) and backs it up with a $1.60 price target, implying shares will move ~32% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Knoblauch’s track record, click here) Knoblauch, while bullish on the stock, is somewhat conservative compared to the general Wall Street view here. The average price target is higher than Alexanders, at $3.70, implying a strong upside potential of ~206% from the $1.21 share price. Unsurprisingly, SOUN has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a unanimous 3 Buys. (See SOUN stock forecast ) Perfect Corp ( PERF ) The next AI stock we’ll look at is Perfect Corp, essentially a SaaS company with a twist. The unique selling point is that it offers augmented reality and artificial solutions to the fashion and beauty sectors. So, how does that work? With the use of facial 3D modelling and deep learning tech, the company’s AI/AR makeup and hair solutions allow users to try on makeup and different hairstyles and dyes digitally. Basically, AI-powered virtual try-on offerings. In a world where so much is shifting online and consumers expect engaging experiences catered to their own style, the company is an early mover with a market leading position in this niche. Formed in 2015, some of the world’s most famous cosmetics companies are already on board; Estee Lauder Group, Coty, Kose, LVMH, and Shiseido are all using the solutions. The company has only been on the public markets since the end of last October when it IPOd via the SPAC route; at the end of November, Perfect announced unaudited financial results for the nine months of the year. Driven by an uptick in AR/AI cloud solutions and subscription revenues, total revenue increased by 22.1% year-over-year to $36.2 million, while gross profit rose from $25.6 million in the same period a year ago to $31.1 million. Even better, net income swung dramatically from a net loss of $3.1 million a year ago to $28.5 million. For Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz, that is just one of the reasons that makes Perfect an appealing investment choice. """"The business is a proven disruptor of the beauty industry, has achieved scale, and is profitably growing at a fast rate,"""" the 5-star analyst said. “We think the pedigree, technology vision, strong culture, and industry experience of its CEO and leadership team will set the company up to be a vertical SaaS leader and become a good compounding growth investment… The beauty and fashion markets for AI/AR solutions are early in evolution; PERF is arguably the best growth asset in the categories for investment.” Accordingly, Schwartz rates PERF shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $10 price target implies 12-month growth of ~25%. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, PERF gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on two penny stocks that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Dar? Bioscience, Inc. ( DARE) We will start with Dar? Biosciences, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused solely on issues of women’s reproductive health. The company’s research program features a portfolio of programs dedicated to improving contraception, fertility, vaginal health, and sexual function. In addition to this pipeline, the company has one approved drug, Xaciato, a clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Xaciato brought Dar? its first revenue, with a $10 million cash payment from Organon in 3Q22, pursuant to the two firms’ license agreement. The two companies are working to coordinate the launch of Xaciato this year. On the pipeline side, Dar? has seen several recent positive developments. In November of last year, the company announced positive topline results from the DARE-VVA1 Phase 1/2 clinical study of tamoxifen, a proprietary drug formulation designed for vaginal application to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with ER/PR+ breast cancer. The company plans to report the results in a peer-reviewed publication. In a second Phase 1/2 study, DARE-HRT1, the company reported positive pharmacokinetic results earlier this month. This study focuses on a monthly intravaginal ring to deliver estrogen and progestogen hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Based on this successful trial, the company plans to advance to a Phase 3 efficacy trial. On the contraceptive track, Dar? has received FDA approval of an IDE application for a pivotal study of Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive device. This approval clears the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which is targeted for initiation in the middle of this year. Dar? is working on Ovaprene in combination with Bayer, and the drug candidate has potential to become the first monthly dosed intravaginal contraceptive on the market. Based on potentially significant catalysts as well as its $1.15 share price, several members of the Street think that now is the right time to pull the trigger. Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

"While the post-pandemic new normal sparked dramatic interest in the electric vehicle segment, not every participant will likely perform well due to issues like consolidation. Tellingly, the recent dramatic enthusiasm around some highly-shorted EV stocks ? in particular, the tickers ARVL and FUV (before its major fall this week) ? appears divorced from fundamentals, warranting extreme caution. I am bearish on both stocks. Nevertheless, the fact that bullishness toward EV stocks exists isn’t a surprising result. For one thing, the entire sector suffered cataclysmic damage in 2022. From a purely speculative angle, the red ink may offer a discounted opportunity. On a broader level, the benchmark CPI report aligned with expectations, indicating that inflation cooled again in December. Logically, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may be less aggressive with its monetary policy, going forward. Moreover, some EV stocks generated such intense bearishness that contrarian traders are willing to take the opposite side of the wager in the hopes of sparking a short squeeze. Essentially, bidding up heavily-shorted shares sparks tremendous pressure among bears, who must return the securities they borrowed to initiate a short position. Thus, by forcing “negative” traders to blink first, the bulls can enjoy massive rewards. As TipRanks reporter Vince Condarcuri mentioned, short-squeeze attempts can burn pessimists targeting the most embattled of organizations. Still, the trade isn’t as easy as it looks. If it was, everybody would be doing it. In the case of the below EV stocks, most investors should probably steer clear. Arrival (ARVL) A British EV manufacturer, Arrival ( NASDAQ:ARVL ) primarily focuses on lightweight commercial vehicles, and at the moment, ARVL features a short interest of 22.84% of its float (float refers to the number of shares available to trade). If an investor was looking at EV stocks strictly during this year so far, Arrival would stand head and shoulders above the competition. Year-to-date, the stock is up 150% and was much higher just a few days ago. Of course, just looking at two weeks’ worth of price action would be incredibly deceptive. Should one examine the trailing-year performance, sobriety would immediately materialize, with ARVL falling nearly 90%. A few token swings higher just don’t make up for prior severe losses. Fundamentally, competition and, specifically, consolidation represent some of the biggest headwinds for Arrival. Considering both the longer-term and near-term history of the automotive industry, it’s clear that the world doesn’t need that many manufacturers. Over time, EV stocks risk being swallowed whole, with the big dogs dominating the sector. Financially, Arrival’s main claim to fame is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.4 times, this metric ranks above 67% of the competition. Otherwise, Arrival remains an aspirational, pre-revenue enterprise that continues to lose money. It’s worth reminding everyone that its retained losses stand at nearly $1.7 billion. Is ARVL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, ARVL stock has a Hold rating based on just one Hold rating. Unfortunately, the stock does not have a price target from the one analyst. Arcimoto (FUV) Headquartered in Eugene, Oregon, Arcimoto ( NASDAQ:FUV ) specializes in what it terms the Fun Utility Vehicle, hence the ticker symbol. A tandem two-seat, three-wheeled EV, Arcimoto’s FUV certainly appears fun to operate. Notably, the stock sports a short interest of 25.9% of its float, making it highly shorted. Better yet, contrarian traders finally decided to take the company out for a spin (until an incident occurred). While not nearly as impressive as Arrival above, Acrimoto certainly held its own temporarily. Last week, FUV gained nearly 32%. At the time, with EV stocks taking a beating in 2022, embattled stakeholders welcomed the sentiment reversal. Unfortunately, the broader narrative changed dramatically earlier this week. According to a report from Electrek, in a last-ditch effort to raise funding, Arcimoto “announced the sale of $12 million in stock at just $3 per share.” Predictably, this action cratered FUV stock. After starting the new year so auspiciously, it’s now down 27%. Financially, it’s difficult to imagine how Arcimoto digs its way out of the hole. About the only conspicuous positive is that the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 170.3%. However, this status will likely change as Arcimoto now struggles against bankruptcy. Therefore, it’s best not to play with FUV and steer well clear of it. Is FUV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, FUV stock has a Hold consensus rating based one Buy, zero Holds, and one Sell rating. The average FUV price target is $10.00, implying 340.53% upside potential. The Takeaway: Some EV Stocks Might Not Make It Although EV stocks represent one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street, the reality is that not everyone in the space will make it. Even with economies of scale, the segment features big-ticket purchases. Therefore, only a few manufacturers have the right stuff to survive.

"""Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times. The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking ? but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts. Rick Schafer, from Oppenheimer, holds the #6 ranking out of more than 8,200 stock pros on Wall Street. The 74% success rate of his stock recommendations puts him head and shoulders above his peers ? and his calls generated a 21% average return over the past 12 months. It’s an impressive record, and it makes his stock reviews always worth a second look. So let’s do that. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three of Schafer’s recent picks. These are all Strong Buy equities ? and Schafer sees them gaining over 40% in the coming months. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. ( AKTS) We’ll start in the tech field, where Akoustis Technologies focuses on the development and use of single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These are a vital component of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, a ubiquitous tech in mobile devices ? the smartphones and tablets that are everywhere now. Akoustis designs, builds, and markets lines of BAW RF filters, and is known for its combination of wide filter bandwidth and superior performance. The biggest recent news for Akoustis was the January 4 announcement that it had closed its acquisition of Grinding and Dicing Services, Inc. (GDSI). GDSI, a US-based provider of high-end semiconductor supply chain services, will make it possible for Akoustis to reshore much of its work to the US ? an important advantage, as last year the Biden Administration saw the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress in an effort to repatriate high-tech supply chains at scale. This important acquisition follows the company’s fiscal Q1 report. For the quarter ending on September 30, 2022, Q1 of fiscal year 2023, Akoustis reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company showed $5.6 million at the top line, for a gain of 195% year-over-year. Akoustis finished the quarter with more than $60 million in cash assets, a net loss per diluted share of 33 cents. In his coverage of Akoustis, top analyst Schafer sees the GDSI acquisition as the main point for investors to consider right now, and he describes the benefits it’s likely to bring as being complementary to Akoustis’ overall position. """"GDSI bolsters AKTS backend capabilities and improves scale. Coupled with RFMi, we see a strengthened position in 5G RAN and smartphone. We see potential for multiple expansion as revenue ramps and management executes on WiFi, 5G RAN, and mobile milestones/profitability,"""" Schafer opined. Schafer goes on to rate AKTS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $7 implies a one-year gain of 131% for the stock. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews on record for AKTS, and they all agree that it is a Buy ? making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $3.03 and their $6.33 average price target suggest an upside of ~109% for the next 12 months. ( See AKTS stock forecast ) Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ( VLN) Next up is Valens, a fabless semiconductor chip company; that is, the company designs chips and produces prototypes, and then contracts the large-scale production lines to third-party chip foundries. Valens was the first to develop HDBaseT tech, the industry standard in audio-video chips, and is an industry leader in A-PHY, known for allowing high-speed connectivity via simplified infrastructure. The company’s PHY tech has found numerous applications in automotive technology, and Valens counts such names as Mercedes-Benz and MobileEye among its customer base. Valens entered the public trading markets in September of 2021, and since then the company has recorded a steady increase in its top line revenues. It showed total revenue of $23.1 million in 3Q22, a company record, and up 21% y/y. The company’s GAAP net loss moderated from $8.5 million in 3Q21 to 3Q22’s $5.3 million loss. The automotive business proved to be a driver of the revenue gains, and Valens reported continued expansion of its VA7000 chipset family, an important component of MIPI A-PHY-compliant automotive technologies. These chips are vital to an array of the sensors ? including cameras, radars, and LiDARs ? that are becoming ever more common in modern vehicles. Covering the stock for Oppenheimer, Rick Schafer describes a clear course forward for the company, including a potentially game-changing total addressable market in the automotive sector. “Looking forward, we see accelerated growth led by auto... We see VA6000 chipset content $25/car and $50/truck... We see VA7000 chipset content goes to $100/car (ASP $5/chip, two chips/link, and 10 links/car). ~100M cars, we est. a $10B TAM opportunity. A-PHY reduces overall system cost by 15% vs. competing SerDes solutions. We expect VLN to announce two additional A-PHY design wins by mid-’23. We like the emergent VLN growth story,” Schafer opined. In-line with an opportunity like this, Schafer rates Valens shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with a price target of $8 pointing toward a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Overall, we’re looking at a tech firm with 3 positive analyst reviews supporting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Valens has a current trading price of $5.69 and its $8.33 average price target suggests a 46% upside by the end of this year. (See VLN stock forecast ) Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL) We’ll warp up with Marvell Technology, another leader in the automotive semiconductor chipset industry. In addition to cars, Marvell’s chips have found applications in data centers, especially in server functions, ethernet networks, and storage accelerators. The company’s chips are also used in SSD controllers. All of this is big business, and Marvell, with its $33 billion market cap, shows that in its financial results. The last reported quarter was 3Q of fiscal year 2023, and Marvell’s top line came in at $1.53 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Drilling down, we find that the revenue total supported several other positive metrics, including a GAAP net income of $13 million, or 2 cents per share ? a solid turnaround from the GAAP loss of $62 million in the year-ago quarter. In non-GAAP measures, Marvell reported net income of $492 million, for a diluted EPS of 57 cents. the company saw $411 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Even though Marvell has reported sound financial results, MRVL shares have seen a twelve-month loss of 47%. In his coverage of this stock, Oppenheimer’s Schafer takes a bullish line, writing, “MRVL remains positioned for diverse, structural growth led by cloud, 5G, and auto. A top pick, we remain long-term buyers."""" Schafer maintains his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Marvell, and his price target, at $70, indicates his confidence in ~80% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Big Tech gets plenty of Wall Street attention ? and unsurprisingly, Marvell has 21 recent analyst reviews on record. These break down 20 to 1 favoring the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading at $39 and their $62.52 average price target implies a 60% upside for the coming year.

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"""Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilized in multiple applications. From image recognition to healthcare, e-commerce to advertising to credit scoring and many other industries - all are making use of AI’s human-like capabilities. And with computing power continuously improving, it is set to get more prevalent over time. One recent example of its impact is ChatGPT ? the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched last November. The tool has quickly caught the public’s imagination with its ability to perform different tasks such as write articles, songs and even write code and its success has only highlighted how AI will keep on impacting our lives. Of course, with any fledgling industry, investors will get an opportunity to buy in and there are publicly traded companies basing their entire value proposition around AI. With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two AI-focused stocks that have the experts singing their praises. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices right now. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) The first AI stock we're looking at is SoundHound AI, a voice assisting specialist. Via speech, its voice AI platform enables consumers to interact with products. This is not some esoteric segment of the market we’re talking about. The company sees a huge TAM (total addressable market) of $160 billion ahead; by 2024, there are expected to be 8 billion voice assistants in use with 75 billion connected devices operating worldwide the following year. SoundHound has some big-name clients on its roster such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Stellantis and Vizio. SoundHound only became a public entity this year, entering the market via the SPAC route back in April. It has been a trial by fire, to say the least. The shares are down by 88% since the debut as SPACs went seriously out of favor in 2022’s bear. Nevertheless, despite worries about the company being able to withstand the tough macro conditions amidst continued losses, it has been posting some impressive growth. In Q3, revenue climbed by 178% YoY to $11.2 million. The company saw a cumulative bookings backlog of $302 million, amounting to a 239% YoY increase - representing a fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth and a company record. In November, the company introduced a new product called Dynamic Interaction, a conversational AI tool that enables businesses to use voice AI technology when servicing customers. Cantor’s Brett Knoblauch thinks it could be a “game-changing technology as it pertains to how humans interact with computers, and more broadly speaking, technology.” “We believe there are numerous use-cases that this technology could be utilized for, with low-hanging fruit being within customer-service settings like restaurants,” the analyst went on to add. “We believe this product 1) further expands upon SOUN's conversational AI advantage; 2) gives us greater visibility into SOUN's revenue trajectory; 3) will accelerate the mix-shift of revenue towards subscription revenue; and 4) expands SOUN's addressable market.” Conveying his confidence, Knoblauch rates SOUN as Overweight (i.e., Buy) and backs it up with a $1.60 price target, implying shares will move ~32% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Knoblauch’s track record, click here) Knoblauch, while bullish on the stock, is somewhat conservative compared to the general Wall Street view here. The average price target is higher than Alexanders, at $3.70, implying a strong upside potential of ~206% from the $1.21 share price. Unsurprisingly, SOUN has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a unanimous 3 Buys. (See SOUN stock forecast ) Perfect Corp ( PERF ) The next AI stock we’ll look at is Perfect Corp, essentially a SaaS company with a twist. The unique selling point is that it offers augmented reality and artificial solutions to the fashion and beauty sectors. So, how does that work? With the use of facial 3D modelling and deep learning tech, the company’s AI/AR makeup and hair solutions allow users to try on makeup and different hairstyles and dyes digitally. Basically, AI-powered virtual try-on offerings. In a world where so much is shifting online and consumers expect engaging experiences catered to their own style, the company is an early mover with a market leading position in this niche. Formed in 2015, some of the world’s most famous cosmetics companies are already on board; Estee Lauder Group, Coty, Kose, LVMH, and Shiseido are all using the solutions. The company has only been on the public markets since the end of last October when it IPOd via the SPAC route; at the end of November, Perfect announced unaudited financial results for the nine months of the year. Driven by an uptick in AR/AI cloud solutions and subscription revenues, total revenue increased by 22.1% year-over-year to $36.2 million, while gross profit rose from $25.6 million in the same period a year ago to $31.1 million. Even better, net income swung dramatically from a net loss of $3.1 million a year ago to $28.5 million. For Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz, that is just one of the reasons that makes Perfect an appealing investment choice. """"The business is a proven disruptor of the beauty industry, has achieved scale, and is profitably growing at a fast rate,"""" the 5-star analyst said. “We think the pedigree, technology vision, strong culture, and industry experience of its CEO and leadership team will set the company up to be a vertical SaaS leader and become a good compounding growth investment… The beauty and fashion markets for AI/AR solutions are early in evolution; PERF is arguably the best growth asset in the categories for investment.” Accordingly, Schwartz rates PERF shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $10 price target implies 12-month growth of ~25%. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, PERF gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"Investor sentiment has been improving, but the contrarians haven’t gone silent. Legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham is predicting hard times ahead, as he lays out his case for doom and gloom to cast a shadow on the markets. In Grantham’s view, the pandemic stock gains were a bubble, and that bubble hasn’t fully popped yet. Putting some numbers to this view, Grantham believes that a further drop of 20% is possible this year ? and in his worst-case scenario, he says that the S&amp;P 500 could collapse as much as 50% from current levels. Backing his view, Grantham says of that worst case, “Even the direst case of a 50% decline from here would leave us at just under 2,000 on the S&amp;P, or about 37% cheap. To put this in perspective, it would still be a far smaller percent deviation from trendline value than the overpricing we had at the end of 2021 of over 70%. So you shouldn't be tempted to think it absolutely cannot happen.” So, what is an investor to do with all this doom and gloom talk? Well, it should prompt a natural turn toward defensive stocks, and especially to the high-yield dividend payers. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull the details on two such equities that offer a market beating dividend yield of at least 8% and a Strong Buy rating from the analyst community. Let's dive in. CTO Realty Growth, Inc. ( CTO) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), as these companies have long been known as dividend champions. CTO Realty Growth operates in nine states, including such major growth areas as Florida and Texas, and manages a portfolio of income-generating properties in the shopping mall and retail niches. Most of the company’s real estate assets are in the Southeast and Southwest regions. CTO also maintains a 15% interest in another REIT, Alpine Income Property Trust. CTO Realty has shown some mixed trends in revenue and income over the past 12 months, which can be seen in the last quarterly report, from 3Q22. At the top line, the total revenue of $23.1 million was up 40% year-over-year, while the bottom line net income attributable to the company fell almost 80%, from $23.9 million to $4.8 million over the same period. During that time however, CTO shares have been outperforming the overall stock market; the S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7% over the last 12 months, while CTO is up 7%. The company will release its 4Q22 results, and its full-year 2022 results, on February 23, less than a month from now. We’ll see then how the trend lines are holding on revenues and earnings. On the dividend front, CTO has been consistently strong. The company has been raising the quarterly common share payment gradually since the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, the dividend pays $1.52 per common share ? and is yielding a solid 8%. This beats inflation by 1.5 points, ensuring a real rate of return. But more importantly, the company pays out reliably ? it’s history of keeping up dividend payments stretches back to the 1970s. BTIG analyst Michael Gorman, in his recent note on real estate investment trusts, revised his top pick in the niche ? and named CTO Realty. “We think CTO should be able to invest accretively in the coming quarters given its ability to monetize its free-standing properties as well as the unique access to ‘other assets’ on the balance sheet. By virtue of CTO’s $17M of subsurface interests and mitigation credits, the $46M structured investments portfolio, and the value of its common stock ownership and management agreement with Alpine Income Property Trust, we think the company has more levers for growth available relative to the majority of our REIT coverage,” Gorman opined. Looking ahead from here, Gorman rates CTO shares a Buy, and his price target of $21 implies a one-year upside potential of 11%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has 19% potential total return profile. (To watch Gorman’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think about CTO's long-term growth prospects? It turns out that other analysts agree with Gorman. The stock received 4 Buys in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. (See CTO stock forecast ) Dynex Capital, Inc. ( DX) Sticking with REIT’s, well turn to the mortgage-backed security niche. Dynex Capital focuses on mortgage loans and securities, investing in these instruments on a leveraged basis. The company’s approach to portfolio development is based on several simple rules, including capital preservation, disciplined capital allocation, and stable returns on the long term. From an investor perspective, those returns include a high-yield dividend, paid out monthly. The most recent payment was declared earlier this month for a February 1 payment at 13 cents per common share. This payment annualizes to $1.56, and gives a yield of 10.8%. The company’s history of reliable payments goes back to 2008, a clear positive for investors to consider. And with inflation still running at 6.5% annualized, the attractions of Dynex Capital’s steady, high-yield payment are clear. Dynex’s operations brought in a total interest income of $20.4 million, as of 3Q22. This compares favorably to the previous quarter’s total of $18.3 million ? although it is down significantly from the $56.1 million reported for 3Q21. Over that same time period, Dynex saw its net income to common shareholders switch from $91.4 million to a loss of $42.5 million. The net loss reflects a sharp decline in the company’s book value, which management attributed to increasing domestic interest rates combined with a difficult geopolitical situation. However, the company's liquidity remains solid. Supporting the dividend, the company reported a non-GAAP earnings available for distribution (EAD) of 24 cents per common share, and had cash holdings of $260.3 million. Even though DX is facing headwinds, Credit Suisse 5-star analyst Douglas Harter recently upgraded his rating on the stock from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy). Backing his bullish stance, Harter writes: “We view the stock as the most attractive among the Agency-focused mREITs to capture potential tightening of MBS spreads. This is based on a higher level of confidence in the sustainability of the dividend (lowest required yield among Agency-focused), attractive P/B valuation (87% of book compared to 97% for other Agency-focused peers), and a stronger relative track record of protecting book value in volatile period.” (To watch Harter’s track record, click here .) Overall, this REIT has picked up 3 analyst reviews recently, and they are all positive and give the stock its unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.

"""Ready to take a trip abroad and scope out some investable brands in far-away lands? As we embark on a new year, it's time to look beyond local businesses, as some of the most intriguing trading opportunities involve international stocks. Granted, this will require extra due diligence as cross-border investing can entail political and economic complexities that are literally foreign to many retail traders. The rewards could certainly be worth the extra effort, however, as the following top-tier international stocks have """"bargain"""" written all over them - and great deals are always worth a look, regardless of their physical location. Let's take a look, then, at CPG, IGIC, and ASML, three worthy international stock picks for 2023. Crescent Point Energy ( NYSE:CPG) Let's start our journey abroad to the Great White North, also known as Canada, where Crescent Point Energy drills for oil and natural gas. While Crescent Point Energy gets light, sweet crude oil out of the ground, investors can collect some sweet distributions as the company has a 3.1% dividend yield on a trailing-12-month basis and a 4.4% yield on a forward basis. Bargain hunters should pay close attention, as Crescent Point Energy's P/E ratio of 2.3x is absolutely rock-bottom. It's entirely conceivable that CPG stock could revisit its $10 from the summer of 2022, especially if oil and natural gas prices rise. Plus, Crescent Point is an aggressive driller that expects to generate annual average production of 134,000 to 138,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2023, so feel free to consider this Canadian energy up-and-comer. What is the Price Target for CPG Stock? CPG has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Crescent Point Energy stock price target of $10.97 implies 59.3% upside potential. International General Insurance Holdings ( NASDAQ:IGIC) Registered in Bermuda, International General Insurance Holdings is ready to insure almost anything -- energy, property, general aviation, marine cargo, professional indemnity, and even political violence. This is a truly international insurer, with operations ranging from Bermuda to London, Malta to Dubai, Casablanca, and beyond. Again, I've handpicked a high-yield, low-valuation prospective winner for you. While International General Insurance Holdings' 2.75% annual dividend yield is tempting, the company's 5.7x P/E ratio is practically irresistible. Furthermore, International General Insurance Holdings demonstrated across-the-board year-over-year improvements in gross written premiums, net premiums earned, profit for the period, and EPS during 2022's third quarter - a solid financial performance for this international pick. What is the Price Target for IGIC Stock? IGIC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on a single Buy rating assigned in the past three months. The average International General Insurance Holdings stock price target of $10 implies 21.5% upside potential. ASML Holding ( NASDAQ:ASML) ASML Holding hails from the Netherlands, and it's not exactly a microchip maker. Rather, this Dutch company creates equipment that can be used to design and manufacture microchips. It's an indirect way to wager on a global recovery in the chip market - and with ASML Holding, you can park your capital in a business that usually beats analysts' quarterly consensus EPS estimates. The 0.95% trailing dividend yield (1.17% forward yield) that ASML Holding pays isn't the main selling point, but it does sweeten the deal. More important is the company's long-term growth story, as ASML Holding envisions sales growth from €18.6 billion euros in 2021 to €44 billion - €60 billion euros in 2030. Moreover, as JPMorgan ( NYSE:JPM ) analyst Sandeep Deshpande points out, ASML Holding has a distinct advantage as the """"sole supplier"""" of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) tools for the microprocessor manufacturing industry. Clearly, this is an international niche-market mover that tech investors should put on their radars. What is the Price Target for ASML Stock? ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average ASML Holding stock price target of $686.60 implies 10.5% upside potential. Conclusion: Should You Consider International Stocks in 2023? Crescent Point Energy, International General Insurance Holdings, and ASML Holding are about as diverse as three companies can be. Yet, they all provide compelling reasons for prospective investors to think outside the box and take a chance on some interesting foreign businesses. All three of them pay dividends and offer growth potential for this year and the years to come. With this in mind, there's only one conclusion to make: international stocks are definitely worth looking into in 2023, and CPG, IGIC, and ASML could be big winners for open-minded financial traders.

"Investor sentiment has been improving, but the contrarians haven’t gone silent. Legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham is predicting hard times ahead, as he lays out his case for doom and gloom to cast a shadow on the markets. In Grantham’s view, the pandemic stock gains were a bubble, and that bubble hasn’t fully popped yet. Putting some numbers to this view, Grantham believes that a further drop of 20% is possible this year ? and in his worst-case scenario, he says that the S&amp;P 500 could collapse as much as 50% from current levels. Backing his view, Grantham says of that worst case, “Even the direst case of a 50% decline from here would leave us at just under 2,000 on the S&amp;P, or about 37% cheap. To put this in perspective, it would still be a far smaller percent deviation from trendline value than the overpricing we had at the end of 2021 of over 70%. So you shouldn't be tempted to think it absolutely cannot happen.” So, what is an investor to do with all this doom and gloom talk? Well, it should prompt a natural turn toward defensive stocks, and especially to the high-yield dividend payers. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull the details on two such equities that offer a market beating dividend yield of at least 8% and a Strong Buy rating from the analyst community. Let's dive in. CTO Realty Growth, Inc. ( CTO) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), as these companies have long been known as dividend champions. CTO Realty Growth operates in nine states, including such major growth areas as Florida and Texas, and manages a portfolio of income-generating properties in the shopping mall and retail niches. Most of the company’s real estate assets are in the Southeast and Southwest regions. CTO also maintains a 15% interest in another REIT, Alpine Income Property Trust. CTO Realty has shown some mixed trends in revenue and income over the past 12 months, which can be seen in the last quarterly report, from 3Q22. At the top line, the total revenue of $23.1 million was up 40% year-over-year, while the bottom line net income attributable to the company fell almost 80%, from $23.9 million to $4.8 million over the same period. During that time however, CTO shares have been outperforming the overall stock market; the S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7% over the last 12 months, while CTO is up 7%. The company will release its 4Q22 results, and its full-year 2022 results, on February 23, less than a month from now. We’ll see then how the trend lines are holding on revenues and earnings. On the dividend front, CTO has been consistently strong. The company has been raising the quarterly common share payment gradually since the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, the dividend pays $1.52 per common share ? and is yielding a solid 8%. This beats inflation by 1.5 points, ensuring a real rate of return. But more importantly, the company pays out reliably ? it’s history of keeping up dividend payments stretches back to the 1970s. BTIG analyst Michael Gorman, in his recent note on real estate investment trusts, revised his top pick in the niche ? and named CTO Realty. “We think CTO should be able to invest accretively in the coming quarters given its ability to monetize its free-standing properties as well as the unique access to ‘other assets’ on the balance sheet. By virtue of CTO’s $17M of subsurface interests and mitigation credits, the $46M structured investments portfolio, and the value of its common stock ownership and management agreement with Alpine Income Property Trust, we think the company has more levers for growth available relative to the majority of our REIT coverage,” Gorman opined. Looking ahead from here, Gorman rates CTO shares a Buy, and his price target of $21 implies a one-year upside potential of 11%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has 19% potential total return profile. (To watch Gorman’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think about CTO's long-term growth prospects? It turns out that other analysts agree with Gorman. The stock received 4 Buys in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. (See CTO stock forecast ) Dynex Capital, Inc. ( DX) Sticking with REIT’s, well turn to the mortgage-backed security niche. Dynex Capital focuses on mortgage loans and securities, investing in these instruments on a leveraged basis. The company’s approach to portfolio development is based on several simple rules, including capital preservation, disciplined capital allocation, and stable returns on the long term. From an investor perspective, those returns include a high-yield dividend, paid out monthly. The most recent payment was declared earlier this month for a February 1 payment at 13 cents per common share. This payment annualizes to $1.56, and gives a yield of 10.8%. The company’s history of reliable payments goes back to 2008, a clear positive for investors to consider. And with inflation still running at 6.5% annualized, the attractions of Dynex Capital’s steady, high-yield payment are clear. Dynex’s operations brought in a total interest income of $20.4 million, as of 3Q22. This compares favorably to the previous quarter’s total of $18.3 million ? although it is down significantly from the $56.1 million reported for 3Q21. Over that same time period, Dynex saw its net income to common shareholders switch from $91.4 million to a loss of $42.5 million. The net loss reflects a sharp decline in the company’s book value, which management attributed to increasing domestic interest rates combined with a difficult geopolitical situation. However, the company's liquidity remains solid. Supporting the dividend, the company reported a non-GAAP earnings available for distribution (EAD) of 24 cents per common share, and had cash holdings of $260.3 million. Even though DX is facing headwinds, Credit Suisse 5-star analyst Douglas Harter recently upgraded his rating on the stock from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy). Backing his bullish stance, Harter writes: “We view the stock as the most attractive among the Agency-focused mREITs to capture potential tightening of MBS spreads. This is based on a higher level of confidence in the sustainability of the dividend (lowest required yield among Agency-focused), attractive P/B valuation (87% of book compared to 97% for other Agency-focused peers), and a stronger relative track record of protecting book value in volatile period.” (To watch Harter’s track record, click here .) Overall, this REIT has picked up 3 analyst reviews recently, and they are all positive and give the stock its unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.

"While the post-pandemic new normal sparked dramatic interest in the electric vehicle segment, not every participant will likely perform well due to issues like consolidation. Tellingly, the recent dramatic enthusiasm around some highly-shorted EV stocks ? in particular, the tickers ARVL and FUV (before its major fall this week) ? appears divorced from fundamentals, warranting extreme caution. I am bearish on both stocks. Nevertheless, the fact that bullishness toward EV stocks exists isn’t a surprising result. For one thing, the entire sector suffered cataclysmic damage in 2022. From a purely speculative angle, the red ink may offer a discounted opportunity. On a broader level, the benchmark CPI report aligned with expectations, indicating that inflation cooled again in December. Logically, this dynamic suggests that the Federal Reserve may be less aggressive with its monetary policy, going forward. Moreover, some EV stocks generated such intense bearishness that contrarian traders are willing to take the opposite side of the wager in the hopes of sparking a short squeeze. Essentially, bidding up heavily-shorted shares sparks tremendous pressure among bears, who must return the securities they borrowed to initiate a short position. Thus, by forcing “negative” traders to blink first, the bulls can enjoy massive rewards. As TipRanks reporter Vince Condarcuri mentioned, short-squeeze attempts can burn pessimists targeting the most embattled of organizations. Still, the trade isn’t as easy as it looks. If it was, everybody would be doing it. In the case of the below EV stocks, most investors should probably steer clear. Arrival (ARVL) A British EV manufacturer, Arrival ( NASDAQ:ARVL ) primarily focuses on lightweight commercial vehicles, and at the moment, ARVL features a short interest of 22.84% of its float (float refers to the number of shares available to trade). If an investor was looking at EV stocks strictly during this year so far, Arrival would stand head and shoulders above the competition. Year-to-date, the stock is up 150% and was much higher just a few days ago. Of course, just looking at two weeks’ worth of price action would be incredibly deceptive. Should one examine the trailing-year performance, sobriety would immediately materialize, with ARVL falling nearly 90%. A few token swings higher just don’t make up for prior severe losses. Fundamentally, competition and, specifically, consolidation represent some of the biggest headwinds for Arrival. Considering both the longer-term and near-term history of the automotive industry, it’s clear that the world doesn’t need that many manufacturers. Over time, EV stocks risk being swallowed whole, with the big dogs dominating the sector. Financially, Arrival’s main claim to fame is its balance sheet. With a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.4 times, this metric ranks above 67% of the competition. Otherwise, Arrival remains an aspirational, pre-revenue enterprise that continues to lose money. It’s worth reminding everyone that its retained losses stand at nearly $1.7 billion. Is ARVL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, ARVL stock has a Hold rating based on just one Hold rating. Unfortunately, the stock does not have a price target from the one analyst. Arcimoto (FUV) Headquartered in Eugene, Oregon, Arcimoto ( NASDAQ:FUV ) specializes in what it terms the Fun Utility Vehicle, hence the ticker symbol. A tandem two-seat, three-wheeled EV, Arcimoto’s FUV certainly appears fun to operate. Notably, the stock sports a short interest of 25.9% of its float, making it highly shorted. Better yet, contrarian traders finally decided to take the company out for a spin (until an incident occurred). While not nearly as impressive as Arrival above, Acrimoto certainly held its own temporarily. Last week, FUV gained nearly 32%. At the time, with EV stocks taking a beating in 2022, embattled stakeholders welcomed the sentiment reversal. Unfortunately, the broader narrative changed dramatically earlier this week. According to a report from Electrek, in a last-ditch effort to raise funding, Arcimoto “announced the sale of $12 million in stock at just $3 per share.” Predictably, this action cratered FUV stock. After starting the new year so auspiciously, it’s now down 27%. Financially, it’s difficult to imagine how Arcimoto digs its way out of the hole. About the only conspicuous positive is that the company’s three-year revenue growth rate stands at 170.3%. However, this status will likely change as Arcimoto now struggles against bankruptcy. Therefore, it’s best not to play with FUV and steer well clear of it. Is FUV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts? Turning to Wall Street, FUV stock has a Hold consensus rating based one Buy, zero Holds, and one Sell rating. The average FUV price target is $10.00, implying 340.53% upside potential. The Takeaway: Some EV Stocks Might Not Make It Although EV stocks represent one of the hottest sectors on Wall Street, the reality is that not everyone in the space will make it. Even with economies of scale, the segment features big-ticket purchases. Therefore, only a few manufacturers have the right stuff to survive.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on two penny stocks that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Dar? Bioscience, Inc. ( DARE) We will start with Dar? Biosciences, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused solely on issues of women’s reproductive health. The company’s research program features a portfolio of programs dedicated to improving contraception, fertility, vaginal health, and sexual function. In addition to this pipeline, the company has one approved drug, Xaciato, a clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Xaciato brought Dar? its first revenue, with a $10 million cash payment from Organon in 3Q22, pursuant to the two firms’ license agreement. The two companies are working to coordinate the launch of Xaciato this year. On the pipeline side, Dar? has seen several recent positive developments. In November of last year, the company announced positive topline results from the DARE-VVA1 Phase 1/2 clinical study of tamoxifen, a proprietary drug formulation designed for vaginal application to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with ER/PR+ breast cancer. The company plans to report the results in a peer-reviewed publication. In a second Phase 1/2 study, DARE-HRT1, the company reported positive pharmacokinetic results earlier this month. This study focuses on a monthly intravaginal ring to deliver estrogen and progestogen hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Based on this successful trial, the company plans to advance to a Phase 3 efficacy trial. On the contraceptive track, Dar? has received FDA approval of an IDE application for a pivotal study of Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive device. This approval clears the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which is targeted for initiation in the middle of this year. Dar? is working on Ovaprene in combination with Bayer, and the drug candidate has potential to become the first monthly dosed intravaginal contraceptive on the market. Based on potentially significant catalysts as well as its $1.15 share price, several members of the Street think that now is the right time to pull the trigger. Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on two penny stocks that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Dar? Bioscience, Inc. ( DARE) We will start with Dar? Biosciences, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused solely on issues of women’s reproductive health. The company’s research program features a portfolio of programs dedicated to improving contraception, fertility, vaginal health, and sexual function. In addition to this pipeline, the company has one approved drug, Xaciato, a clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Xaciato brought Dar? its first revenue, with a $10 million cash payment from Organon in 3Q22, pursuant to the two firms’ license agreement. The two companies are working to coordinate the launch of Xaciato this year. On the pipeline side, Dar? has seen several recent positive developments. In November of last year, the company announced positive topline results from the DARE-VVA1 Phase 1/2 clinical study of tamoxifen, a proprietary drug formulation designed for vaginal application to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with ER/PR+ breast cancer. The company plans to report the results in a peer-reviewed publication. In a second Phase 1/2 study, DARE-HRT1, the company reported positive pharmacokinetic results earlier this month. This study focuses on a monthly intravaginal ring to deliver estrogen and progestogen hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Based on this successful trial, the company plans to advance to a Phase 3 efficacy trial. On the contraceptive track, Dar? has received FDA approval of an IDE application for a pivotal study of Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive device. This approval clears the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which is targeted for initiation in the middle of this year. Dar? is working on Ovaprene in combination with Bayer, and the drug candidate has potential to become the first monthly dosed intravaginal contraceptive on the market. Based on potentially significant catalysts as well as its $1.15 share price, several members of the Street think that now is the right time to pull the trigger. Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

"""Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times. The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking ? but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts. Rick Schafer, from Oppenheimer, holds the #6 ranking out of more than 8,200 stock pros on Wall Street. The 74% success rate of his stock recommendations puts him head and shoulders above his peers ? and his calls generated a 21% average return over the past 12 months. It’s an impressive record, and it makes his stock reviews always worth a second look. So let’s do that. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three of Schafer’s recent picks. These are all Strong Buy equities ? and Schafer sees them gaining over 40% in the coming months. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. ( AKTS) We’ll start in the tech field, where Akoustis Technologies focuses on the development and use of single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These are a vital component of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, a ubiquitous tech in mobile devices ? the smartphones and tablets that are everywhere now. Akoustis designs, builds, and markets lines of BAW RF filters, and is known for its combination of wide filter bandwidth and superior performance. The biggest recent news for Akoustis was the January 4 announcement that it had closed its acquisition of Grinding and Dicing Services, Inc. (GDSI). GDSI, a US-based provider of high-end semiconductor supply chain services, will make it possible for Akoustis to reshore much of its work to the US ? an important advantage, as last year the Biden Administration saw the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress in an effort to repatriate high-tech supply chains at scale. This important acquisition follows the company’s fiscal Q1 report. For the quarter ending on September 30, 2022, Q1 of fiscal year 2023, Akoustis reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company showed $5.6 million at the top line, for a gain of 195% year-over-year. Akoustis finished the quarter with more than $60 million in cash assets, a net loss per diluted share of 33 cents. In his coverage of Akoustis, top analyst Schafer sees the GDSI acquisition as the main point for investors to consider right now, and he describes the benefits it’s likely to bring as being complementary to Akoustis’ overall position. """"GDSI bolsters AKTS backend capabilities and improves scale. Coupled with RFMi, we see a strengthened position in 5G RAN and smartphone. We see potential for multiple expansion as revenue ramps and management executes on WiFi, 5G RAN, and mobile milestones/profitability,"""" Schafer opined. Schafer goes on to rate AKTS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $7 implies a one-year gain of 131% for the stock. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews on record for AKTS, and they all agree that it is a Buy ? making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $3.03 and their $6.33 average price target suggest an upside of ~109% for the next 12 months. ( See AKTS stock forecast ) Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ( VLN) Next up is Valens, a fabless semiconductor chip company; that is, the company designs chips and produces prototypes, and then contracts the large-scale production lines to third-party chip foundries. Valens was the first to develop HDBaseT tech, the industry standard in audio-video chips, and is an industry leader in A-PHY, known for allowing high-speed connectivity via simplified infrastructure. The company’s PHY tech has found numerous applications in automotive technology, and Valens counts such names as Mercedes-Benz and MobileEye among its customer base. Valens entered the public trading markets in September of 2021, and since then the company has recorded a steady increase in its top line revenues. It showed total revenue of $23.1 million in 3Q22, a company record, and up 21% y/y. The company’s GAAP net loss moderated from $8.5 million in 3Q21 to 3Q22’s $5.3 million loss. The automotive business proved to be a driver of the revenue gains, and Valens reported continued expansion of its VA7000 chipset family, an important component of MIPI A-PHY-compliant automotive technologies. These chips are vital to an array of the sensors ? including cameras, radars, and LiDARs ? that are becoming ever more common in modern vehicles. Covering the stock for Oppenheimer, Rick Schafer describes a clear course forward for the company, including a potentially game-changing total addressable market in the automotive sector. “Looking forward, we see accelerated growth led by auto... We see VA6000 chipset content $25/car and $50/truck... We see VA7000 chipset content goes to $100/car (ASP $5/chip, two chips/link, and 10 links/car). ~100M cars, we est. a $10B TAM opportunity. A-PHY reduces overall system cost by 15% vs. competing SerDes solutions. We expect VLN to announce two additional A-PHY design wins by mid-’23. We like the emergent VLN growth story,” Schafer opined. In-line with an opportunity like this, Schafer rates Valens shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with a price target of $8 pointing toward a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Overall, we’re looking at a tech firm with 3 positive analyst reviews supporting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Valens has a current trading price of $5.69 and its $8.33 average price target suggests a 46% upside by the end of this year. (See VLN stock forecast ) Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL) We’ll warp up with Marvell Technology, another leader in the automotive semiconductor chipset industry. In addition to cars, Marvell’s chips have found applications in data centers, especially in server functions, ethernet networks, and storage accelerators. The company’s chips are also used in SSD controllers. All of this is big business, and Marvell, with its $33 billion market cap, shows that in its financial results. The last reported quarter was 3Q of fiscal year 2023, and Marvell’s top line came in at $1.53 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Drilling down, we find that the revenue total supported several other positive metrics, including a GAAP net income of $13 million, or 2 cents per share ? a solid turnaround from the GAAP loss of $62 million in the year-ago quarter. In non-GAAP measures, Marvell reported net income of $492 million, for a diluted EPS of 57 cents. the company saw $411 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Even though Marvell has reported sound financial results, MRVL shares have seen a twelve-month loss of 47%. In his coverage of this stock, Oppenheimer’s Schafer takes a bullish line, writing, “MRVL remains positioned for diverse, structural growth led by cloud, 5G, and auto. A top pick, we remain long-term buyers."""" Schafer maintains his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Marvell, and his price target, at $70, indicates his confidence in ~80% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Big Tech gets plenty of Wall Street attention ? and unsurprisingly, Marvell has 21 recent analyst reviews on record. These break down 20 to 1 favoring the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading at $39 and their $62.52 average price target implies a 60% upside for the coming year.

"Airport stocks are rarely brought to the attention of retail investors. Yet, they can be marvelous investments due to their one-of-a-kind features. In this article, we are looking at three airport stocks whose unique qualities position them well for a potential takeoff in 2023. Particularly, Mexico-based Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste ( NYSE: ASR ), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico ( NYSE: PAC ), and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte ( NYSE: OMAB ) have been experiencing improvements in their financials over the past several quarters following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their shares trading near all-time high levels after outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) in the past year, their unique traits and attractive valuations could imply further upside in 2023, even though analysts don't expect upside from these stocks (see below). What Makes Airport Stocks Attractive Investments? Airports are totally unique assets that come with multiple attractive and investor-friendly characteristics. Let's go through three of the most significant traits that benefit airport stocks. 1. High-Quality, Diversified Revenues One of the most attractive characteristics of airports is that they enjoy high-quality revenues via multiple sources. Firstly, airports sign multi-year leases with airlines. These leases are usually long-term agreements that can provide a steady and predictable source of cash flow for the airport. Further, airports generate cash flows from a variety of other sources, including concessions, parking, and real estate rentals. Airlines are usually big, reputable businesses. Most are publicly traded, with transparent financials, while airports are incredibly critical for them to operate. Therefore, airports have minimal risks when it comes to collecting their rightful fees. Additionally, whether it comes from collecting car parking revenues, rental income from businesses operating within the airport, or other fees, these are high-margin cash flows with minimal operating costs. Airports provide the space and overall infrastructure but don't actually go through the hassle of operating these businesses directly, which makes for a great business model. 2. Growing Travel Demand The COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on the travel industry between 2020 and 2021. However, demand for travel has been rebounding, resulting in a growing demand for vacation and commercial trips. Flights generated revenues of just $36.4 billion in the U.S. in 2020, a massive drop from their pre-pandemic figure of $108.4 billion in 2019. With demand for travel rebounding strongly, flights are expected to generate revenues of $130.9 billion in 2023 - a new all-time high. Additionally, revenues are expected to grow by a CAGR of 3% through 2027. This means that airports are likely to be negotiating more leases with airlines, organically benefiting from the industry's growth without additional efforts. 3. Limited Investable Opportunities Finally, airport stocks benefit from the fact that there are only a few investable opportunities in the space. This makes them highly-attractive assets. This comes in two forms. Firstly, most airports around the world are wholly or partly owned by governments. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Denver International Airport, for instance, are owned and operated by The City of Los Angeles and the City &amp; County of Denver, respectively. Thus, investors have no opportunity to invest in the bulk of the world's airports. Secondly, airports are highly regulated and have essentially no competition in their respective markets. It's not like a potential competitor can go and build an airport next to an existing one and compete. Besides, they require enormous capital expenditures to contrast. In any case, this is also another reason why investors have very limited options when it comes to gaining exposure to airports, which makes the existing publicly-traded stocks like ASR, PAC, and OMAB highly scarce and attractive assets. Takeaway: Why are These Airport Stocks Worth Considering? Besides the attractive characteristics attached to airport stocks, as just discussed, ASR, PAC, and OMAB have multiple charming features on their own, which makes them attractive investments worth considering. Firstly, they are the biggest publicly-traded companies in the space, with exposure to multiple assets. I mentioned that airports benefit from diversified cash flows; ASR, PAC, and OMAB, each own nine, 12, and 13 airports, respectively. Further, the companies have a consistent history of generating sustainable profits and returning capital to shareholders due to their multiples qualities, as mentioned earlier. OMAB stock financials The combination of growing profits which has resulted in share price gains and hefty dividends has resulted in ASR, PAC, and OMAB stocks recording total returns of 353.2%, 322.2%, and 181.6%, respectively, over the past decade. Regarding their dividends, it's worth noting that while ASR, PAC, and OMAB do not have consistent track records, they do tend to grow their payouts in line with their profits. Unless you really value consistency when it comes to dividend growth, they should still serve adequately when it comes to growing your income over time. Finally, despite their shares trading near all-time high levels, all three stocks appear to be quite attractively priced. Specifically, ASR, PAC, and OMAB are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 13.8x, 14.5x, and 16.4x, respectively. These multiples are below their historical averages. Regardless, I find these multiples very cheap, considering the positive qualities attached to airport stocks. Thus, I believe all three stocks have strong prospects to keep flying higher through 2023. Disclosure",1,호재

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"""Ready to take a trip abroad and scope out some investable brands in far-away lands? As we embark on a new year, it's time to look beyond local businesses, as some of the most intriguing trading opportunities involve international stocks. Granted, this will require extra due diligence as cross-border investing can entail political and economic complexities that are literally foreign to many retail traders. The rewards could certainly be worth the extra effort, however, as the following top-tier international stocks have """"bargain"""" written all over them - and great deals are always worth a look, regardless of their physical location. Let's take a look, then, at CPG, IGIC, and ASML, three worthy international stock picks for 2023. Crescent Point Energy ( NYSE:CPG) Let's start our journey abroad to the Great White North, also known as Canada, where Crescent Point Energy drills for oil and natural gas. While Crescent Point Energy gets light, sweet crude oil out of the ground, investors can collect some sweet distributions as the company has a 3.1% dividend yield on a trailing-12-month basis and a 4.4% yield on a forward basis. Bargain hunters should pay close attention, as Crescent Point Energy's P/E ratio of 2.3x is absolutely rock-bottom. It's entirely conceivable that CPG stock could revisit its $10 from the summer of 2022, especially if oil and natural gas prices rise. Plus, Crescent Point is an aggressive driller that expects to generate annual average production of 134,000 to 138,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2023, so feel free to consider this Canadian energy up-and-comer. What is the Price Target for CPG Stock? CPG has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Crescent Point Energy stock price target of $10.97 implies 59.3% upside potential. International General Insurance Holdings ( NASDAQ:IGIC) Registered in Bermuda, International General Insurance Holdings is ready to insure almost anything -- energy, property, general aviation, marine cargo, professional indemnity, and even political violence. This is a truly international insurer, with operations ranging from Bermuda to London, Malta to Dubai, Casablanca, and beyond. Again, I've handpicked a high-yield, low-valuation prospective winner for you. While International General Insurance Holdings' 2.75% annual dividend yield is tempting, the company's 5.7x P/E ratio is practically irresistible. Furthermore, International General Insurance Holdings demonstrated across-the-board year-over-year improvements in gross written premiums, net premiums earned, profit for the period, and EPS during 2022's third quarter - a solid financial performance for this international pick. What is the Price Target for IGIC Stock? IGIC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on a single Buy rating assigned in the past three months. The average International General Insurance Holdings stock price target of $10 implies 21.5% upside potential. ASML Holding ( NASDAQ:ASML) ASML Holding hails from the Netherlands, and it's not exactly a microchip maker. Rather, this Dutch company creates equipment that can be used to design and manufacture microchips. It's an indirect way to wager on a global recovery in the chip market - and with ASML Holding, you can park your capital in a business that usually beats analysts' quarterly consensus EPS estimates. The 0.95% trailing dividend yield (1.17% forward yield) that ASML Holding pays isn't the main selling point, but it does sweeten the deal. More important is the company's long-term growth story, as ASML Holding envisions sales growth from €18.6 billion euros in 2021 to €44 billion - €60 billion euros in 2030. Moreover, as JPMorgan ( NYSE:JPM ) analyst Sandeep Deshpande points out, ASML Holding has a distinct advantage as the """"sole supplier"""" of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) tools for the microprocessor manufacturing industry. Clearly, this is an international niche-market mover that tech investors should put on their radars. What is the Price Target for ASML Stock? ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average ASML Holding stock price target of $686.60 implies 10.5% upside potential. Conclusion: Should You Consider International Stocks in 2023? Crescent Point Energy, International General Insurance Holdings, and ASML Holding are about as diverse as three companies can be. Yet, they all provide compelling reasons for prospective investors to think outside the box and take a chance on some interesting foreign businesses. All three of them pay dividends and offer growth potential for this year and the years to come. With this in mind, there's only one conclusion to make: international stocks are definitely worth looking into in 2023, and CPG, IGIC, and ASML could be big winners for open-minded financial traders.

"Airport stocks are rarely brought to the attention of retail investors. Yet, they can be marvelous investments due to their one-of-a-kind features. In this article, we are looking at three airport stocks whose unique qualities position them well for a potential takeoff in 2023. Particularly, Mexico-based Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste ( NYSE: ASR ), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico ( NYSE: PAC ), and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte ( NYSE: OMAB ) have been experiencing improvements in their financials over the past several quarters following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their shares trading near all-time high levels after outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) in the past year, their unique traits and attractive valuations could imply further upside in 2023, even though analysts don't expect upside from these stocks (see below). What Makes Airport Stocks Attractive Investments? Airports are totally unique assets that come with multiple attractive and investor-friendly characteristics. Let's go through three of the most significant traits that benefit airport stocks. 1. High-Quality, Diversified Revenues One of the most attractive characteristics of airports is that they enjoy high-quality revenues via multiple sources. Firstly, airports sign multi-year leases with airlines. These leases are usually long-term agreements that can provide a steady and predictable source of cash flow for the airport. Further, airports generate cash flows from a variety of other sources, including concessions, parking, and real estate rentals. Airlines are usually big, reputable businesses. Most are publicly traded, with transparent financials, while airports are incredibly critical for them to operate. Therefore, airports have minimal risks when it comes to collecting their rightful fees. Additionally, whether it comes from collecting car parking revenues, rental income from businesses operating within the airport, or other fees, these are high-margin cash flows with minimal operating costs. Airports provide the space and overall infrastructure but don't actually go through the hassle of operating these businesses directly, which makes for a great business model. 2. Growing Travel Demand The COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on the travel industry between 2020 and 2021. However, demand for travel has been rebounding, resulting in a growing demand for vacation and commercial trips. Flights generated revenues of just $36.4 billion in the U.S. in 2020, a massive drop from their pre-pandemic figure of $108.4 billion in 2019. With demand for travel rebounding strongly, flights are expected to generate revenues of $130.9 billion in 2023 - a new all-time high. Additionally, revenues are expected to grow by a CAGR of 3% through 2027. This means that airports are likely to be negotiating more leases with airlines, organically benefiting from the industry's growth without additional efforts. 3. Limited Investable Opportunities Finally, airport stocks benefit from the fact that there are only a few investable opportunities in the space. This makes them highly-attractive assets. This comes in two forms. Firstly, most airports around the world are wholly or partly owned by governments. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Denver International Airport, for instance, are owned and operated by The City of Los Angeles and the City &amp; County of Denver, respectively. Thus, investors have no opportunity to invest in the bulk of the world's airports. Secondly, airports are highly regulated and have essentially no competition in their respective markets. It's not like a potential competitor can go and build an airport next to an existing one and compete. Besides, they require enormous capital expenditures to contrast. In any case, this is also another reason why investors have very limited options when it comes to gaining exposure to airports, which makes the existing publicly-traded stocks like ASR, PAC, and OMAB highly scarce and attractive assets. Takeaway: Why are These Airport Stocks Worth Considering? Besides the attractive characteristics attached to airport stocks, as just discussed, ASR, PAC, and OMAB have multiple charming features on their own, which makes them attractive investments worth considering. Firstly, they are the biggest publicly-traded companies in the space, with exposure to multiple assets. I mentioned that airports benefit from diversified cash flows; ASR, PAC, and OMAB, each own nine, 12, and 13 airports, respectively. Further, the companies have a consistent history of generating sustainable profits and returning capital to shareholders due to their multiples qualities, as mentioned earlier. OMAB stock financials The combination of growing profits which has resulted in share price gains and hefty dividends has resulted in ASR, PAC, and OMAB stocks recording total returns of 353.2%, 322.2%, and 181.6%, respectively, over the past decade. Regarding their dividends, it's worth noting that while ASR, PAC, and OMAB do not have consistent track records, they do tend to grow their payouts in line with their profits. Unless you really value consistency when it comes to dividend growth, they should still serve adequately when it comes to growing your income over time. Finally, despite their shares trading near all-time high levels, all three stocks appear to be quite attractively priced. Specifically, ASR, PAC, and OMAB are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 13.8x, 14.5x, and 16.4x, respectively. These multiples are below their historical averages. Regardless, I find these multiples very cheap, considering the positive qualities attached to airport stocks. Thus, I believe all three stocks have strong prospects to keep flying higher through 2023. Disclosure",1,호재

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"""While the big-name stocks may get the attention and the headlines, they’re not the only game in town. And sometimes, the market giants aren’t even the best place to turn for solid returns on that initial investment. There are small- to mid-cap stocks in the market that can present an unbeatable combination for income-minded investors: share appreciation and high-yielding dividend returns. These stocks, however, can go undercover, slipping under investors’ radar, for numerous reasons, everything from living in unusual business niches to consistent failure to post profits, but sometimes the reason can be much more mundane: they’re just smaller companies. It’s inevitable that some sound equities will get overlooked. With this in mind, we've used the TipRanks platform to pinpoint two lesser-known stocks with dividend yields exceeding 8%. And even better, they both have a Buy rating from the Street’s analysts and solid upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. ( CCAP) We’ll start with Crescent Capital, a BDC firm that is part of the larger Crescent Group. Crescent Capital BDC offers a range of financial services to mid-market private enterprises, the type of companies that has long been drivers of the overall US economy but are frequently too small to access extensive credit and financing services from the traditional banking sector. Crescent serves this base through loan origination, equity purchases, and debt investments; the company’s portfolio totals over $1.29 billion in fair value and leans heavily toward unitranche first liens (62.7%) and senior secured first lien (25.4%). Crescent Capital will be reporting its Q4 financial results in February; analysts are forecasting bottom-line earnings of 44 cents per share. It’s interesting to note that the company has beaten the EPS guidance by approximately 21% in each of the last two quarters reported. In the most recent, 3Q22, the company showed total investment income of $29 million, up 13% year-over-year, and a net investment income of $16 million, up 26% y/y. Net investment income per common share for Q3 came to 52 cents, compared to the 45 cents reported in the prior-year quarter. Back in November, Crescent Capital declared its Q4 dividend, which was paid out this past January 17. The payment was set at 41 cents per common share, and the annualized rate of $1.64 gives a yield of 11.5%. This yield is nearly 5 points higher than December’s 6.5% annualized rate of inflation, and nearly 6x the average dividend paid by S&amp;P-listed companies. It should be noted that, since Q4 of 2021, Crescent Capital has, in addition to its 41-cent regular quarterly dividend, also consistently paid out a 5-cent special dividend. The Fed is committed to fighting inflation through increased interest rates, and Raymond James’ 5-star analyst Robert Dodd sees this as a net gain for Crescent. He writes, “Rising base rates should benefit earnings in 4Q22. The earnings benefit from higher rates is the plus side of inflation, the downside is margin pressure, and its impact on some portfolio companies. We do expect portfolio deterioration, and rising non-accruals as we head into the back end of the year (for all BDCs), but we believe that rate benefits will overwhelm the potential negative impact of non-accrual increases in the near/medium term.” At the bottom line, Dodd says, “We see an attractive risk/reward, with positive rate sensitivity and strong credit quality ? for a BDC trading at a material discount to current NAV/Share, and at a discount multiple to its peer group.” Taking this forward, Dodd gives CCAP shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target, set at $18, implies that a one-year gain of ~25% lies ahead. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~36% potential total return profile. (To watch Dodd’s track record, click here) Overall, this BDC has picked up 3 recent analyst reviews ? and they are all positive, supporting a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $14.42, with a $17.67 average price target suggesting ~22% upside potential over the next 12 months. (See CCAP stock forecast ) Piedmont Office Realty Trust ( PDM) From the BDC world we’ll shift our focus to a real estate investment trust (REIT), another leading sector among dividend payors. Piedmont Office is a ‘fully-integrated and self-managed’ REIT, focusing on the ownership and management of high-end, Class A office buildings in high-growth Sunbelt cities such as Orlando, Atlanta, and Dallas. The company also has a strong presence in the northeast, in Boston, New York, and DC. In addition to existing office space, Piedmont has ownership of prime land plots, totaling 3 million square feet, for build-to-suit or pre-leased projects. Come February 8, Piedmont is scheduled to release its 4Q22 and FY2022 results. The company has already published full-year guidance of $73 million to $74 million in net income, and core funds from operations per diluted share of $1.99 to $2.01. Keeping these numbers in mind, we can look back at 3Q22, the last quarter reported. In that quarter, the company had a net income of $3.33 million; the first three quarters of 2022 saw a net income of $71.26 million. Net income per share for the quarter came to 3 cents, missing the 6-cent forecast by a wide margin. The company’s core funds from operations ? a key measure for dividend investors, as it funds the payments ? for Q3 remained in line with the prior-year results, at $61.35 million. Core FFO came to 50 cents per share in 3Q22. Even though Piedmont’s income has fallen over the past year, the company had no problem covering the 21 cent common share dividend payment. The dividend was declared in October and paid out on January 3 of this year. At 84 cents per common share, the annualized payment yields 8.5%, beating inflation by a solid 2 points. Piedmont has a long history of keeping its dividend reliable; the company has paid out a regular quarterly div since 2009, and has maintained the current payment since 2014. Assessing the outlook for Piedmont, Baird analyst Dave Rodgers explains why this REIT remains a top pick: “We believe PDM is among the best positioned to outperform during 2023. The current space market is denoted by Office leasing activity concentrated across small-to-mid-sized tenants supporting 1) PDM’s focus on value-add and asset repositioning; 2) its 14ksf average in-place tenant size; and 3) its 8ksf average size for 2023 lease expirations."""" """"While we expect leasing to be an opportunity for PDM, the bigger catalyst, in our view, is the likely recovery in the investment sales market ?driving PDM’s return to its capital recycling strategy and the accretive exit of NYC, Boston and Houston in the near term,"""" Rodgers added. Rodgers goes on to give PDM shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, with a price target of $13, indicating his confidence in a 28% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Rodgers’ track record, click here) This stock holds a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus, based on 3 recent reviews that include 2 Buys and 1 Hold. The average price target of $13.67 suggests a 35% upside potential from the current trading price of $10.12.

"""Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times. The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking ? but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts. Rick Schafer, from Oppenheimer, holds the #6 ranking out of more than 8,200 stock pros on Wall Street. The 74% success rate of his stock recommendations puts him head and shoulders above his peers ? and his calls generated a 21% average return over the past 12 months. It’s an impressive record, and it makes his stock reviews always worth a second look. So let’s do that. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three of Schafer’s recent picks. These are all Strong Buy equities ? and Schafer sees them gaining over 40% in the coming months. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. ( AKTS) We’ll start in the tech field, where Akoustis Technologies focuses on the development and use of single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These are a vital component of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, a ubiquitous tech in mobile devices ? the smartphones and tablets that are everywhere now. Akoustis designs, builds, and markets lines of BAW RF filters, and is known for its combination of wide filter bandwidth and superior performance. The biggest recent news for Akoustis was the January 4 announcement that it had closed its acquisition of Grinding and Dicing Services, Inc. (GDSI). GDSI, a US-based provider of high-end semiconductor supply chain services, will make it possible for Akoustis to reshore much of its work to the US ? an important advantage, as last year the Biden Administration saw the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress in an effort to repatriate high-tech supply chains at scale. This important acquisition follows the company’s fiscal Q1 report. For the quarter ending on September 30, 2022, Q1 of fiscal year 2023, Akoustis reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company showed $5.6 million at the top line, for a gain of 195% year-over-year. Akoustis finished the quarter with more than $60 million in cash assets, a net loss per diluted share of 33 cents. In his coverage of Akoustis, top analyst Schafer sees the GDSI acquisition as the main point for investors to consider right now, and he describes the benefits it’s likely to bring as being complementary to Akoustis’ overall position. """"GDSI bolsters AKTS backend capabilities and improves scale. Coupled with RFMi, we see a strengthened position in 5G RAN and smartphone. We see potential for multiple expansion as revenue ramps and management executes on WiFi, 5G RAN, and mobile milestones/profitability,"""" Schafer opined. Schafer goes on to rate AKTS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $7 implies a one-year gain of 131% for the stock. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews on record for AKTS, and they all agree that it is a Buy ? making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $3.03 and their $6.33 average price target suggest an upside of ~109% for the next 12 months. ( See AKTS stock forecast ) Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ( VLN) Next up is Valens, a fabless semiconductor chip company; that is, the company designs chips and produces prototypes, and then contracts the large-scale production lines to third-party chip foundries. Valens was the first to develop HDBaseT tech, the industry standard in audio-video chips, and is an industry leader in A-PHY, known for allowing high-speed connectivity via simplified infrastructure. The company’s PHY tech has found numerous applications in automotive technology, and Valens counts such names as Mercedes-Benz and MobileEye among its customer base. Valens entered the public trading markets in September of 2021, and since then the company has recorded a steady increase in its top line revenues. It showed total revenue of $23.1 million in 3Q22, a company record, and up 21% y/y. The company’s GAAP net loss moderated from $8.5 million in 3Q21 to 3Q22’s $5.3 million loss. The automotive business proved to be a driver of the revenue gains, and Valens reported continued expansion of its VA7000 chipset family, an important component of MIPI A-PHY-compliant automotive technologies. These chips are vital to an array of the sensors ? including cameras, radars, and LiDARs ? that are becoming ever more common in modern vehicles. Covering the stock for Oppenheimer, Rick Schafer describes a clear course forward for the company, including a potentially game-changing total addressable market in the automotive sector. “Looking forward, we see accelerated growth led by auto... We see VA6000 chipset content $25/car and $50/truck... We see VA7000 chipset content goes to $100/car (ASP $5/chip, two chips/link, and 10 links/car). ~100M cars, we est. a $10B TAM opportunity. A-PHY reduces overall system cost by 15% vs. competing SerDes solutions. We expect VLN to announce two additional A-PHY design wins by mid-’23. We like the emergent VLN growth story,” Schafer opined. In-line with an opportunity like this, Schafer rates Valens shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with a price target of $8 pointing toward a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Overall, we’re looking at a tech firm with 3 positive analyst reviews supporting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Valens has a current trading price of $5.69 and its $8.33 average price target suggests a 46% upside by the end of this year. (See VLN stock forecast ) Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL) We’ll warp up with Marvell Technology, another leader in the automotive semiconductor chipset industry. In addition to cars, Marvell’s chips have found applications in data centers, especially in server functions, ethernet networks, and storage accelerators. The company’s chips are also used in SSD controllers. All of this is big business, and Marvell, with its $33 billion market cap, shows that in its financial results. The last reported quarter was 3Q of fiscal year 2023, and Marvell’s top line came in at $1.53 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Drilling down, we find that the revenue total supported several other positive metrics, including a GAAP net income of $13 million, or 2 cents per share ? a solid turnaround from the GAAP loss of $62 million in the year-ago quarter. In non-GAAP measures, Marvell reported net income of $492 million, for a diluted EPS of 57 cents. the company saw $411 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Even though Marvell has reported sound financial results, MRVL shares have seen a twelve-month loss of 47%. In his coverage of this stock, Oppenheimer’s Schafer takes a bullish line, writing, “MRVL remains positioned for diverse, structural growth led by cloud, 5G, and auto. A top pick, we remain long-term buyers."""" Schafer maintains his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Marvell, and his price target, at $70, indicates his confidence in ~80% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Big Tech gets plenty of Wall Street attention ? and unsurprisingly, Marvell has 21 recent analyst reviews on record. These break down 20 to 1 favoring the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading at $39 and their $62.52 average price target implies a 60% upside for the coming year.

"Airport stocks are rarely brought to the attention of retail investors. Yet, they can be marvelous investments due to their one-of-a-kind features. In this article, we are looking at three airport stocks whose unique qualities position them well for a potential takeoff in 2023. Particularly, Mexico-based Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste ( NYSE: ASR ), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico ( NYSE: PAC ), and Grupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte ( NYSE: OMAB ) have been experiencing improvements in their financials over the past several quarters following the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite their shares trading near all-time high levels after outperforming the S&amp;P 500 ( SPX ) in the past year, their unique traits and attractive valuations could imply further upside in 2023, even though analysts don't expect upside from these stocks (see below). What Makes Airport Stocks Attractive Investments? Airports are totally unique assets that come with multiple attractive and investor-friendly characteristics. Let's go through three of the most significant traits that benefit airport stocks. 1. High-Quality, Diversified Revenues One of the most attractive characteristics of airports is that they enjoy high-quality revenues via multiple sources. Firstly, airports sign multi-year leases with airlines. These leases are usually long-term agreements that can provide a steady and predictable source of cash flow for the airport. Further, airports generate cash flows from a variety of other sources, including concessions, parking, and real estate rentals. Airlines are usually big, reputable businesses. Most are publicly traded, with transparent financials, while airports are incredibly critical for them to operate. Therefore, airports have minimal risks when it comes to collecting their rightful fees. Additionally, whether it comes from collecting car parking revenues, rental income from businesses operating within the airport, or other fees, these are high-margin cash flows with minimal operating costs. Airports provide the space and overall infrastructure but don't actually go through the hassle of operating these businesses directly, which makes for a great business model. 2. Growing Travel Demand The COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on the travel industry between 2020 and 2021. However, demand for travel has been rebounding, resulting in a growing demand for vacation and commercial trips. Flights generated revenues of just $36.4 billion in the U.S. in 2020, a massive drop from their pre-pandemic figure of $108.4 billion in 2019. With demand for travel rebounding strongly, flights are expected to generate revenues of $130.9 billion in 2023 - a new all-time high. Additionally, revenues are expected to grow by a CAGR of 3% through 2027. This means that airports are likely to be negotiating more leases with airlines, organically benefiting from the industry's growth without additional efforts. 3. Limited Investable Opportunities Finally, airport stocks benefit from the fact that there are only a few investable opportunities in the space. This makes them highly-attractive assets. This comes in two forms. Firstly, most airports around the world are wholly or partly owned by governments. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) or Denver International Airport, for instance, are owned and operated by The City of Los Angeles and the City &amp; County of Denver, respectively. Thus, investors have no opportunity to invest in the bulk of the world's airports. Secondly, airports are highly regulated and have essentially no competition in their respective markets. It's not like a potential competitor can go and build an airport next to an existing one and compete. Besides, they require enormous capital expenditures to contrast. In any case, this is also another reason why investors have very limited options when it comes to gaining exposure to airports, which makes the existing publicly-traded stocks like ASR, PAC, and OMAB highly scarce and attractive assets. Takeaway: Why are These Airport Stocks Worth Considering? Besides the attractive characteristics attached to airport stocks, as just discussed, ASR, PAC, and OMAB have multiple charming features on their own, which makes them attractive investments worth considering. Firstly, they are the biggest publicly-traded companies in the space, with exposure to multiple assets. I mentioned that airports benefit from diversified cash flows; ASR, PAC, and OMAB, each own nine, 12, and 13 airports, respectively. Further, the companies have a consistent history of generating sustainable profits and returning capital to shareholders due to their multiples qualities, as mentioned earlier. OMAB stock financials The combination of growing profits which has resulted in share price gains and hefty dividends has resulted in ASR, PAC, and OMAB stocks recording total returns of 353.2%, 322.2%, and 181.6%, respectively, over the past decade. Regarding their dividends, it's worth noting that while ASR, PAC, and OMAB do not have consistent track records, they do tend to grow their payouts in line with their profits. Unless you really value consistency when it comes to dividend growth, they should still serve adequately when it comes to growing your income over time. Finally, despite their shares trading near all-time high levels, all three stocks appear to be quite attractively priced. Specifically, ASR, PAC, and OMAB are currently trading at forward P/E ratios of 13.8x, 14.5x, and 16.4x, respectively. These multiples are below their historical averages. Regardless, I find these multiples very cheap, considering the positive qualities attached to airport stocks. Thus, I believe all three stocks have strong prospects to keep flying higher through 2023. Disclosure",1,호재

Let's take a look, then, at CPG, IGIC, and ASML, three worthy international stock picks for 2023. Crescent Point Energy ( NYSE:CPG) Let's start our journey abroad to the Great White North, also known as Canada, where Crescent Point Energy drills for oil and natural gas. While Crescent Point Energy gets light, sweet crude oil out of the ground, investors can collect some sweet distributions as the company has a 3.1% dividend yield on a trailing-12-month basis and a 4.4% yield on a forward basis. Bargain hunters should pay close attention, as Crescent Point Energy's P/E ratio of 2.3x is absolutely rock-bottom. It's entirely conceivable that CPG stock could revisit its $10 from the summer of 2022, especially if oil and natural gas prices rise. Plus, Crescent Point is an aggressive driller that expects to generate annual average production of 134,000 to 138,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2023, so feel free to consider this Canadian energy up-and-comer. What is the Price Target for CPG Stock? CPG has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Crescent Point Energy stock price target of $10.97 implies 59.3% upside potential. International General Insurance Holdings ( NASDAQ:IGIC) Registered in Bermuda, International General Insurance Holdings is ready to insure almost anything -- energy, property, general aviation, marine cargo, professional indemnity, and even political violence. This is a truly international insurer, with operations ranging from Bermuda to London, Malta to Dubai, Casablanca, and beyond. Again, I've handpicked a high-yield, low-valuation prospective winner for you. While International General Insurance Holdings' 2.75% annual dividend yield is tempting, the company's 5.7x P/E ratio is practically irresistible. Furthermore, International General Insurance Holdings demonstrated across-the-board year-over-year improvements in gross written premiums, net premiums earned, profit for the period, and EPS during 2022's third quarter - a solid financial performance for this international pick. What is the Price Target for IGIC Stock? IGIC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on a single Buy rating assigned in the past three months. The average International General Insurance Holdings stock price target of $10 implies 21.5% upside potential. ASML Holding ( NASDAQ:ASML) ASML Holding hails from the Netherlands, and it's not exactly a microchip maker. Rather, this Dutch company creates equipment that can be used to design and manufacture microchips. It's an indirect way to wager on a global recovery in the chip market - and with ASML Holding, you can park your capital in a business that usually beats analysts' quarterly consensus EPS estimates. The 0.95% trailing dividend yield (1.17% forward yield) that ASML Holding pays isn't the main selling point, but it does sweeten the deal. More important is the company's long-term growth story, as ASML Holding envisions sales growth from €18.6 billion euros in 2021 to €44 billion - €60 billion euros in 2030. Moreover, as JPMorgan ( NYSE:JPM ) analyst Sandeep Deshpande points out, ASML Holding has a distinct advantage as the """"sole supplier"""" of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) tools for the microprocessor manufacturing industry. Clearly, this is an international niche-market mover that tech investors should put on their radars. What is the Price Target for ASML Stock? ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average ASML Holding stock price target of $686.60 implies 10.5% upside potential. Conclusion: Should You Consider International Stocks in 2023? Crescent Point Energy, International General Insurance Holdings, and ASML Holding are about as diverse as three companies can be. Yet, they all provide compelling reasons for prospective investors to think outside the box and take a chance on some interesting foreign businesses. All three of them pay dividends and offer growth potential for this year and the years to come. With this in mind, there's only one conclusion to make: international stocks are definitely worth looking into in 2023, and CPG, IGIC, and ASML could be big winners for open-minded financial traders.

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

Here are five stocks added to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) List today:,1,호재
"""Finding the right stock is the key to successful investing, but it’s never as easy as it sounds. The answer to the question, which stock to buy? is no secret, but it is hidden, in the avalanche of data that the markets produce. What’s needed is some clear signal that will cut through the noise and indicate the right stocks for the times. The quantity of data, and the sheer impossibility of parsing all of it in real time, makes a formidable barrier to successful stock picking ? but Wall Street’s analysts have that part under control, which turns the question into one that’s much more manageable: which analysts to follow? The quick answer is, follow the top-ranked analysts. Rick Schafer, from Oppenheimer, holds the #6 ranking out of more than 8,200 stock pros on Wall Street. The 74% success rate of his stock recommendations puts him head and shoulders above his peers ? and his calls generated a 21% average return over the past 12 months. It’s an impressive record, and it makes his stock reviews always worth a second look. So let’s do that. Using TipRanks database, we’ve pulled up the latest scoop on three of Schafer’s recent picks. These are all Strong Buy equities ? and Schafer sees them gaining over 40% in the coming months. Akoustis Technologies, Inc. ( AKTS) We’ll start in the tech field, where Akoustis Technologies focuses on the development and use of single-crystal piezoelectric materials. These are a vital component of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters, a ubiquitous tech in mobile devices ? the smartphones and tablets that are everywhere now. Akoustis designs, builds, and markets lines of BAW RF filters, and is known for its combination of wide filter bandwidth and superior performance. The biggest recent news for Akoustis was the January 4 announcement that it had closed its acquisition of Grinding and Dicing Services, Inc. (GDSI). GDSI, a US-based provider of high-end semiconductor supply chain services, will make it possible for Akoustis to reshore much of its work to the US ? an important advantage, as last year the Biden Administration saw the CHIPS and Science Act through Congress in an effort to repatriate high-tech supply chains at scale. This important acquisition follows the company’s fiscal Q1 report. For the quarter ending on September 30, 2022, Q1 of fiscal year 2023, Akoustis reported its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. The company showed $5.6 million at the top line, for a gain of 195% year-over-year. Akoustis finished the quarter with more than $60 million in cash assets, a net loss per diluted share of 33 cents. In his coverage of Akoustis, top analyst Schafer sees the GDSI acquisition as the main point for investors to consider right now, and he describes the benefits it’s likely to bring as being complementary to Akoustis’ overall position. """"GDSI bolsters AKTS backend capabilities and improves scale. Coupled with RFMi, we see a strengthened position in 5G RAN and smartphone. We see potential for multiple expansion as revenue ramps and management executes on WiFi, 5G RAN, and mobile milestones/profitability,"""" Schafer opined. Schafer goes on to rate AKTS shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his price target of $7 implies a one-year gain of 131% for the stock. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here ) Overall, there are 3 recent analyst reviews on record for AKTS, and they all agree that it is a Buy ? making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The shares are priced at $3.03 and their $6.33 average price target suggest an upside of ~109% for the next 12 months. ( See AKTS stock forecast ) Valens Semiconductor Ltd. ( VLN) Next up is Valens, a fabless semiconductor chip company; that is, the company designs chips and produces prototypes, and then contracts the large-scale production lines to third-party chip foundries. Valens was the first to develop HDBaseT tech, the industry standard in audio-video chips, and is an industry leader in A-PHY, known for allowing high-speed connectivity via simplified infrastructure. The company’s PHY tech has found numerous applications in automotive technology, and Valens counts such names as Mercedes-Benz and MobileEye among its customer base. Valens entered the public trading markets in September of 2021, and since then the company has recorded a steady increase in its top line revenues. It showed total revenue of $23.1 million in 3Q22, a company record, and up 21% y/y. The company’s GAAP net loss moderated from $8.5 million in 3Q21 to 3Q22’s $5.3 million loss. The automotive business proved to be a driver of the revenue gains, and Valens reported continued expansion of its VA7000 chipset family, an important component of MIPI A-PHY-compliant automotive technologies. These chips are vital to an array of the sensors ? including cameras, radars, and LiDARs ? that are becoming ever more common in modern vehicles. Covering the stock for Oppenheimer, Rick Schafer describes a clear course forward for the company, including a potentially game-changing total addressable market in the automotive sector. “Looking forward, we see accelerated growth led by auto... We see VA6000 chipset content $25/car and $50/truck... We see VA7000 chipset content goes to $100/car (ASP $5/chip, two chips/link, and 10 links/car). ~100M cars, we est. a $10B TAM opportunity. A-PHY reduces overall system cost by 15% vs. competing SerDes solutions. We expect VLN to announce two additional A-PHY design wins by mid-’23. We like the emergent VLN growth story,” Schafer opined. In-line with an opportunity like this, Schafer rates Valens shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with a price target of $8 pointing toward a 41% one-year upside potential. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Overall, we’re looking at a tech firm with 3 positive analyst reviews supporting a Strong Buy consensus rating. Valens has a current trading price of $5.69 and its $8.33 average price target suggests a 46% upside by the end of this year. (See VLN stock forecast ) Marvell Technology Group ( MRVL) We’ll warp up with Marvell Technology, another leader in the automotive semiconductor chipset industry. In addition to cars, Marvell’s chips have found applications in data centers, especially in server functions, ethernet networks, and storage accelerators. The company’s chips are also used in SSD controllers. All of this is big business, and Marvell, with its $33 billion market cap, shows that in its financial results. The last reported quarter was 3Q of fiscal year 2023, and Marvell’s top line came in at $1.53 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Drilling down, we find that the revenue total supported several other positive metrics, including a GAAP net income of $13 million, or 2 cents per share ? a solid turnaround from the GAAP loss of $62 million in the year-ago quarter. In non-GAAP measures, Marvell reported net income of $492 million, for a diluted EPS of 57 cents. the company saw $411 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter. Even though Marvell has reported sound financial results, MRVL shares have seen a twelve-month loss of 47%. In his coverage of this stock, Oppenheimer’s Schafer takes a bullish line, writing, “MRVL remains positioned for diverse, structural growth led by cloud, 5G, and auto. A top pick, we remain long-term buyers."""" Schafer maintains his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Marvell, and his price target, at $70, indicates his confidence in ~80% share appreciation on the one-year horizon. (To watch Schafer’s track record, click here) Big Tech gets plenty of Wall Street attention ? and unsurprisingly, Marvell has 21 recent analyst reviews on record. These break down 20 to 1 favoring the Buys over Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares are trading at $39 and their $62.52 average price target implies a 60% upside for the coming year.

"While the overall stock market direction so far this year remains up, the path ahead still presents plenty of potential headwinds. Inflation has yet to be properly tamed, the geopolitical map remains uncertain with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still ongoing and Covid variants could reappear at any time. Add in the prospect for a fiery battle in Congress around raising the debt ceiling, and Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus thinks market volatility is “unlikely to leave the landscape.” However, these should not act as deterrents for stock investing, with Stoltzfus noting “there never is ‘an all clear signal’ sounded over the markets.” “Experience tells us that with opportunity comes risk and with risk comes opportunity whether in everyday life, businesses on Main Street, or in the Canyons of Wall Street,” he went to say, before championing “diversification.” With that idea in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that Stoltzfus’ analyst colleagues at the banking firm believe make sound investment choices right now. In fact, one of them, according to the analysts, could surge as much as 170% over the next 12 months. Let's take a closer look. Icosavax, Inc. ( ICVX) The first name we’ll look at is Icosavax, a research-oriented biotech company working on new classes of vaccines using virus-like particles, with the aim of protecting older adults from respiratory viruses. The company is now at the clinical trial stage, with four research tracks in progress, two at the Phase 1 stage and two more in pre-clinical stages. Icosavax’s most advanced pipeline candidate, IVX-121, is under investigation as a vaccine for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is currently at the Phase 1b stage, and the data released so far has been encouraging. The second advanced program is the Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12, a combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate developed through the fusion of IVX-121 with the company’s older drug candidate, IVX-241. The Phase 1 trial should have a topline data readout in the middle of the year. A Phase 2 trial of this candidate is planned for initiation in 2H23. Icosavax is pre-revenue, as it does not yet have a product on the market or partnership agreements with other drug companies. On the financial side, however, the company does have resources to lean on ? in its last financial report, for 3Q22, the company had $222.5 million in cash on hand, enough to fund operations into 2024. Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Hartaj Singh follows this stock, and he takes an upbeat stance on this vax developer’s path. Singh writes: “We believe that the company has a differentiated vaccine platform, utilizing virus-line particles (VLPs) to manufacture and test vaccines against respiratory pathogens in humans. This scalable platform can help produce differentiated vaccines with a robust risk/benefit profile and durable immunogenicity… The company exits 2022 with robust Phase 1 data in RSV, and with 6-month durability. In 2023, we expect proof-of-concept (PoC) in bivalent RSV/hMPV and 12-month RSV data. We are bullish.” Bullish, indeed. Going forward from this position, Singh rates Icosavax shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a price target of $27 to suggest a robust 170% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Singh’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap biotech has picked up 5 recent analyst reviews ? and they are unanimously positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See ICVX stock forecast ) Toll Brothers, Inc. ( TOL) Next up is Toll Brothers, a Fortune 500 company in the construction industry. Toll Brothers designs, builds, markets, and finances residential and commercial properties in the US. The company is one of the largest such firms operating in the US real estate and construction industry, and is one of the top-five home builders in the US. Persistently high inflation, and the Fed’s increased interest rates in response, have put heavy pressure on the real estate and construction sector, and TOL shares finished a rocky 2022 with a 30% annual loss. However, the shares have been on the up in recent months boosted by strong FQ4 (October quarter) results, in which the company beat expectations. Toll reported a bottom-line EPS of $5.63, beating the analyst forecast of $3.94 by a wide margin ? and growing 86% year-over-year. At the top line, the company had revenues of $3.71 billion, a solid $500 million above the consensus estimate, and up 22% from fiscal 4Q21. Two conflicting metrics will show how the current environment remains difficult to navigate. The company’s backlog of homes had, as of the end of fiscal 2022, an average price of $1.095 million, up from $922,100 at the end of the prior fiscal year. Higher prices can help to offset lower demand ? but demand is dropping quickly, as evidenced by a Q4 y/y spike in cancellations as a percentage of signed contracts, from 4.6% to 20.8%. It remains to be seen which metric ? higher prices or falling demand ? will predominate going forward. Putting these metrics aside, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory, Toll shares are trading at 'compelling valuation levels.' “We see less downside risk to gross margin than with other builders given its to-be-built business model and backlog. These factors should also allow the company to be patient in terms of managing its pace and price in FY23. We also think the company should get credit for having the best balance sheet and leverage profile in its history. With shares trading at 0.92x consensus FY23E BVPS (book value per share), we think the risk/reward is attractive,” Batory opined. In Batory’s view, TOL deserves an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $71 implies a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Batory’s track record, click here) With 9 recent analyst reviews on file, breaking down to 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, this stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"While the overall stock market direction so far this year remains up, the path ahead still presents plenty of potential headwinds. Inflation has yet to be properly tamed, the geopolitical map remains uncertain with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still ongoing and Covid variants could reappear at any time. Add in the prospect for a fiery battle in Congress around raising the debt ceiling, and Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus thinks market volatility is “unlikely to leave the landscape.” However, these should not act as deterrents for stock investing, with Stoltzfus noting “there never is ‘an all clear signal’ sounded over the markets.” “Experience tells us that with opportunity comes risk and with risk comes opportunity whether in everyday life, businesses on Main Street, or in the Canyons of Wall Street,” he went to say, before championing “diversification.” With that idea in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that Stoltzfus’ analyst colleagues at the banking firm believe make sound investment choices right now. In fact, one of them, according to the analysts, could surge as much as 170% over the next 12 months. Let's take a closer look. Icosavax, Inc. ( ICVX) The first name we’ll look at is Icosavax, a research-oriented biotech company working on new classes of vaccines using virus-like particles, with the aim of protecting older adults from respiratory viruses. The company is now at the clinical trial stage, with four research tracks in progress, two at the Phase 1 stage and two more in pre-clinical stages. Icosavax’s most advanced pipeline candidate, IVX-121, is under investigation as a vaccine for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is currently at the Phase 1b stage, and the data released so far has been encouraging. The second advanced program is the Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12, a combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate developed through the fusion of IVX-121 with the company’s older drug candidate, IVX-241. The Phase 1 trial should have a topline data readout in the middle of the year. A Phase 2 trial of this candidate is planned for initiation in 2H23. Icosavax is pre-revenue, as it does not yet have a product on the market or partnership agreements with other drug companies. On the financial side, however, the company does have resources to lean on ? in its last financial report, for 3Q22, the company had $222.5 million in cash on hand, enough to fund operations into 2024. Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Hartaj Singh follows this stock, and he takes an upbeat stance on this vax developer’s path. Singh writes: “We believe that the company has a differentiated vaccine platform, utilizing virus-line particles (VLPs) to manufacture and test vaccines against respiratory pathogens in humans. This scalable platform can help produce differentiated vaccines with a robust risk/benefit profile and durable immunogenicity… The company exits 2022 with robust Phase 1 data in RSV, and with 6-month durability. In 2023, we expect proof-of-concept (PoC) in bivalent RSV/hMPV and 12-month RSV data. We are bullish.” Bullish, indeed. Going forward from this position, Singh rates Icosavax shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a price target of $27 to suggest a robust 170% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Singh’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap biotech has picked up 5 recent analyst reviews ? and they are unanimously positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See ICVX stock forecast ) Toll Brothers, Inc. ( TOL) Next up is Toll Brothers, a Fortune 500 company in the construction industry. Toll Brothers designs, builds, markets, and finances residential and commercial properties in the US. The company is one of the largest such firms operating in the US real estate and construction industry, and is one of the top-five home builders in the US. Persistently high inflation, and the Fed’s increased interest rates in response, have put heavy pressure on the real estate and construction sector, and TOL shares finished a rocky 2022 with a 30% annual loss. However, the shares have been on the up in recent months boosted by strong FQ4 (October quarter) results, in which the company beat expectations. Toll reported a bottom-line EPS of $5.63, beating the analyst forecast of $3.94 by a wide margin ? and growing 86% year-over-year. At the top line, the company had revenues of $3.71 billion, a solid $500 million above the consensus estimate, and up 22% from fiscal 4Q21. Two conflicting metrics will show how the current environment remains difficult to navigate. The company’s backlog of homes had, as of the end of fiscal 2022, an average price of $1.095 million, up from $922,100 at the end of the prior fiscal year. Higher prices can help to offset lower demand ? but demand is dropping quickly, as evidenced by a Q4 y/y spike in cancellations as a percentage of signed contracts, from 4.6% to 20.8%. It remains to be seen which metric ? higher prices or falling demand ? will predominate going forward. Putting these metrics aside, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory, Toll shares are trading at 'compelling valuation levels.' “We see less downside risk to gross margin than with other builders given its to-be-built business model and backlog. These factors should also allow the company to be patient in terms of managing its pace and price in FY23. We also think the company should get credit for having the best balance sheet and leverage profile in its history. With shares trading at 0.92x consensus FY23E BVPS (book value per share), we think the risk/reward is attractive,” Batory opined. In Batory’s view, TOL deserves an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $71 implies a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Batory’s track record, click here) With 9 recent analyst reviews on file, breaking down to 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, this stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on two penny stocks that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Dar? Bioscience, Inc. ( DARE) We will start with Dar? Biosciences, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused solely on issues of women’s reproductive health. The company’s research program features a portfolio of programs dedicated to improving contraception, fertility, vaginal health, and sexual function. In addition to this pipeline, the company has one approved drug, Xaciato, a clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Xaciato brought Dar? its first revenue, with a $10 million cash payment from Organon in 3Q22, pursuant to the two firms’ license agreement. The two companies are working to coordinate the launch of Xaciato this year. On the pipeline side, Dar? has seen several recent positive developments. In November of last year, the company announced positive topline results from the DARE-VVA1 Phase 1/2 clinical study of tamoxifen, a proprietary drug formulation designed for vaginal application to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with ER/PR+ breast cancer. The company plans to report the results in a peer-reviewed publication. In a second Phase 1/2 study, DARE-HRT1, the company reported positive pharmacokinetic results earlier this month. This study focuses on a monthly intravaginal ring to deliver estrogen and progestogen hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Based on this successful trial, the company plans to advance to a Phase 3 efficacy trial. On the contraceptive track, Dar? has received FDA approval of an IDE application for a pivotal study of Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive device. This approval clears the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which is targeted for initiation in the middle of this year. Dar? is working on Ovaprene in combination with Bayer, and the drug candidate has potential to become the first monthly dosed intravaginal contraceptive on the market. Based on potentially significant catalysts as well as its $1.15 share price, several members of the Street think that now is the right time to pull the trigger. Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

"""Risk and reward often travel hand-in-hand, making the stock market both lucrative and dangerous. Among the best exemplars of this axiom are the penny stocks, those equities priced at $5 or less. With that low price comes the potential for extreme gains, as even an incrementally small price increase will translate to a high percentage gain. However, before jumping right into an investment in a penny stock, Wall Street pros advise looking at the bigger picture and considering other factors beyond just the price tag. For some names that fall into this category, you really do get what you pay for, offering little in the way of long-term growth prospects thanks to weak fundamentals, recent headwinds or even large outstanding share counts. As the nature of these investments makes it difficult to gauge the strength of their long-term growth prospects, one effective stock selecting strategy is to follow the analysts’ advice. Using TipRanks’ database, we locked in on two penny stocks that have garnered glowing reviews from the Street, enough to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention each offers massive upside potential. Let's take a closer look. Dar? Bioscience, Inc. ( DARE) We will start with Dar? Biosciences, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused solely on issues of women’s reproductive health. The company’s research program features a portfolio of programs dedicated to improving contraception, fertility, vaginal health, and sexual function. In addition to this pipeline, the company has one approved drug, Xaciato, a clindamycin phosphate vaginal gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Xaciato brought Dar? its first revenue, with a $10 million cash payment from Organon in 3Q22, pursuant to the two firms’ license agreement. The two companies are working to coordinate the launch of Xaciato this year. On the pipeline side, Dar? has seen several recent positive developments. In November of last year, the company announced positive topline results from the DARE-VVA1 Phase 1/2 clinical study of tamoxifen, a proprietary drug formulation designed for vaginal application to treat vulvar and vaginal atrophy in patients with ER/PR+ breast cancer. The company plans to report the results in a peer-reviewed publication. In a second Phase 1/2 study, DARE-HRT1, the company reported positive pharmacokinetic results earlier this month. This study focuses on a monthly intravaginal ring to deliver estrogen and progestogen hormones for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Based on this successful trial, the company plans to advance to a Phase 3 efficacy trial. On the contraceptive track, Dar? has received FDA approval of an IDE application for a pivotal study of Ovaprene, a hormone-free monthly intravaginal contraceptive device. This approval clears the way for a Phase 3 clinical trial, which is targeted for initiation in the middle of this year. Dar? is working on Ovaprene in combination with Bayer, and the drug candidate has potential to become the first monthly dosed intravaginal contraceptive on the market. Based on potentially significant catalysts as well as its $1.15 share price, several members of the Street think that now is the right time to pull the trigger. Among the DARE bulls is Jones Trading analyst Catherine Novack, who writes, “We see Dar? as an undervalued player in the women's health space, and are bullish on the name because: 1) Contraception is a blockbuster indication, and Dar?'s Ovaprene will potentially be the only monthly non-hormonal option on the market; 2) Dar?'s portfolio assets are approvable via the 505(b)(2) pathway, de-risking regulatory approval; 3) Commercial partnerships with big players in the women's health space (Organon and Bayer) eliminate the need for a sales team and provide non-dilutive sources of funding; and 4) Attractive risk/benefit profile of pipeline products for sexual dysfunction, vulvovaginal atrophy, and pregnancy maintenance.” Novack backs up her bullish stance with a Buy rating on the stock, while her $6 price target suggests a whopping upside potential of 422%. (To watch Novack’s track record, click here) The Street is clearly optimistic on this penny stock, as all 5 recent analyst reviews are positive ? for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. With an average price target of $5, the upside potential comes in at ~335%. ( See DARE stock forecast on TipRanks) Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. ( XLO) Next up is Xilio, a biotech firm working on advanced, next-generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Specifically, the company develops drug candidates with potential to improve patient outcome by focusing the immune system’s activity directly and selectively to the site of the tumor. Xilio has a proprietary development platform and is building novel, tumor-activated molecules for optimal effect in the tumor microenvironment. The company’s three active clinical trial programs are all at early stages ? but have been showing promising results. The first trial, an ongoing Phase 1 study of XTX202, is testing the tumor-activated against interleukin-2, or IL-2, as a treatment for advanced solid tumors. The study has successfully reached the target dose range, and showed preliminary evidence of increased CD8+ effector T cells and NK cells. Xilio plan to start enrollment in a Phase 2 monotherapy study during 1H23, and to report preliminary data on safety and anti-tumor activity from the Phase 1/2 trial in 3Q23. On the second trial, of XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 drug candidate, the company has received FDA clearance of the IND application to conduct an active clinical study. Xilio plans to initiate patient dosing in a Phase 1 clinical trial during this quarter and expects to report preliminary data from the Phase 1 trial during 4Q23. The final clinical study focuses on XTX101, a tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4. This drug candidate is part of the company’s cytokine program. Xilio has this drug candidate in a Phase 1 trial against advanced solid tumors, and is currently seeking a partner in order to conduct further testing. In a review of Xilio for Chardan, analyst Matthew Barcus writes: """"We see strong potential with the company's two lead cytokine programs XTX202 and XTX301... We currently model XLO's assets achieving $320 mm in projected risk-adjusted 2030 sales. We believe XLO is well-positioned to become a leader in the field of immuno-oncology and we look forward to multiple key catalysts in 2023 from the company's programs. Looking forward, Barcus rates XLO shares a Buy, and his price target of $7 implies that the stock has a 12-month upside potential of 143%. (To watch Barcus’ track record, click here) That’s a bullish take ? but the Street is even more optimistic. XLO has a Strong Buy consensus based on 4 unanimously positive analyst reviews, and the average price target of $12.25 suggests a one-year gain of ~326% from the current share price of $2.88.

"While the overall stock market direction so far this year remains up, the path ahead still presents plenty of potential headwinds. Inflation has yet to be properly tamed, the geopolitical map remains uncertain with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still ongoing and Covid variants could reappear at any time. Add in the prospect for a fiery battle in Congress around raising the debt ceiling, and Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus thinks market volatility is “unlikely to leave the landscape.” However, these should not act as deterrents for stock investing, with Stoltzfus noting “there never is ‘an all clear signal’ sounded over the markets.” “Experience tells us that with opportunity comes risk and with risk comes opportunity whether in everyday life, businesses on Main Street, or in the Canyons of Wall Street,” he went to say, before championing “diversification.” With that idea in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that Stoltzfus’ analyst colleagues at the banking firm believe make sound investment choices right now. In fact, one of them, according to the analysts, could surge as much as 170% over the next 12 months. Let's take a closer look. Icosavax, Inc. ( ICVX) The first name we’ll look at is Icosavax, a research-oriented biotech company working on new classes of vaccines using virus-like particles, with the aim of protecting older adults from respiratory viruses. The company is now at the clinical trial stage, with four research tracks in progress, two at the Phase 1 stage and two more in pre-clinical stages. Icosavax’s most advanced pipeline candidate, IVX-121, is under investigation as a vaccine for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is currently at the Phase 1b stage, and the data released so far has been encouraging. The second advanced program is the Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12, a combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate developed through the fusion of IVX-121 with the company’s older drug candidate, IVX-241. The Phase 1 trial should have a topline data readout in the middle of the year. A Phase 2 trial of this candidate is planned for initiation in 2H23. Icosavax is pre-revenue, as it does not yet have a product on the market or partnership agreements with other drug companies. On the financial side, however, the company does have resources to lean on ? in its last financial report, for 3Q22, the company had $222.5 million in cash on hand, enough to fund operations into 2024. Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Hartaj Singh follows this stock, and he takes an upbeat stance on this vax developer’s path. Singh writes: “We believe that the company has a differentiated vaccine platform, utilizing virus-line particles (VLPs) to manufacture and test vaccines against respiratory pathogens in humans. This scalable platform can help produce differentiated vaccines with a robust risk/benefit profile and durable immunogenicity… The company exits 2022 with robust Phase 1 data in RSV, and with 6-month durability. In 2023, we expect proof-of-concept (PoC) in bivalent RSV/hMPV and 12-month RSV data. We are bullish.” Bullish, indeed. Going forward from this position, Singh rates Icosavax shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a price target of $27 to suggest a robust 170% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Singh’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap biotech has picked up 5 recent analyst reviews ? and they are unanimously positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See ICVX stock forecast ) Toll Brothers, Inc. ( TOL) Next up is Toll Brothers, a Fortune 500 company in the construction industry. Toll Brothers designs, builds, markets, and finances residential and commercial properties in the US. The company is one of the largest such firms operating in the US real estate and construction industry, and is one of the top-five home builders in the US. Persistently high inflation, and the Fed’s increased interest rates in response, have put heavy pressure on the real estate and construction sector, and TOL shares finished a rocky 2022 with a 30% annual loss. However, the shares have been on the up in recent months boosted by strong FQ4 (October quarter) results, in which the company beat expectations. Toll reported a bottom-line EPS of $5.63, beating the analyst forecast of $3.94 by a wide margin ? and growing 86% year-over-year. At the top line, the company had revenues of $3.71 billion, a solid $500 million above the consensus estimate, and up 22% from fiscal 4Q21. Two conflicting metrics will show how the current environment remains difficult to navigate. The company’s backlog of homes had, as of the end of fiscal 2022, an average price of $1.095 million, up from $922,100 at the end of the prior fiscal year. Higher prices can help to offset lower demand ? but demand is dropping quickly, as evidenced by a Q4 y/y spike in cancellations as a percentage of signed contracts, from 4.6% to 20.8%. It remains to be seen which metric ? higher prices or falling demand ? will predominate going forward. Putting these metrics aside, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory, Toll shares are trading at 'compelling valuation levels.' “We see less downside risk to gross margin than with other builders given its to-be-built business model and backlog. These factors should also allow the company to be patient in terms of managing its pace and price in FY23. We also think the company should get credit for having the best balance sheet and leverage profile in its history. With shares trading at 0.92x consensus FY23E BVPS (book value per share), we think the risk/reward is attractive,” Batory opined. In Batory’s view, TOL deserves an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $71 implies a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Batory’s track record, click here) With 9 recent analyst reviews on file, breaking down to 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, this stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""Ready to take a trip abroad and scope out some investable brands in far-away lands? As we embark on a new year, it's time to look beyond local businesses, as some of the most intriguing trading opportunities involve international stocks. Granted, this will require extra due diligence as cross-border investing can entail political and economic complexities that are literally foreign to many retail traders. The rewards could certainly be worth the extra effort, however, as the following top-tier international stocks have """"bargain"""" written all over them - and great deals are always worth a look, regardless of their physical location. Let's take a look, then, at CPG, IGIC, and ASML, three worthy international stock picks for 2023. Crescent Point Energy ( NYSE:CPG) Let's start our journey abroad to the Great White North, also known as Canada, where Crescent Point Energy drills for oil and natural gas. While Crescent Point Energy gets light, sweet crude oil out of the ground, investors can collect some sweet distributions as the company has a 3.1% dividend yield on a trailing-12-month basis and a 4.4% yield on a forward basis. Bargain hunters should pay close attention, as Crescent Point Energy's P/E ratio of 2.3x is absolutely rock-bottom. It's entirely conceivable that CPG stock could revisit its $10 from the summer of 2022, especially if oil and natural gas prices rise. Plus, Crescent Point is an aggressive driller that expects to generate annual average production of 134,000 to 138,000 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent) in 2023, so feel free to consider this Canadian energy up-and-comer. What is the Price Target for CPG Stock? CPG has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Crescent Point Energy stock price target of $10.97 implies 59.3% upside potential. International General Insurance Holdings ( NASDAQ:IGIC) Registered in Bermuda, International General Insurance Holdings is ready to insure almost anything -- energy, property, general aviation, marine cargo, professional indemnity, and even political violence. This is a truly international insurer, with operations ranging from Bermuda to London, Malta to Dubai, Casablanca, and beyond. Again, I've handpicked a high-yield, low-valuation prospective winner for you. While International General Insurance Holdings' 2.75% annual dividend yield is tempting, the company's 5.7x P/E ratio is practically irresistible. Furthermore, International General Insurance Holdings demonstrated across-the-board year-over-year improvements in gross written premiums, net premiums earned, profit for the period, and EPS during 2022's third quarter - a solid financial performance for this international pick. What is the Price Target for IGIC Stock? IGIC has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on a single Buy rating assigned in the past three months. The average International General Insurance Holdings stock price target of $10 implies 21.5% upside potential. ASML Holding ( NASDAQ:ASML) ASML Holding hails from the Netherlands, and it's not exactly a microchip maker. Rather, this Dutch company creates equipment that can be used to design and manufacture microchips. It's an indirect way to wager on a global recovery in the chip market - and with ASML Holding, you can park your capital in a business that usually beats analysts' quarterly consensus EPS estimates. The 0.95% trailing dividend yield (1.17% forward yield) that ASML Holding pays isn't the main selling point, but it does sweeten the deal. More important is the company's long-term growth story, as ASML Holding envisions sales growth from €18.6 billion euros in 2021 to €44 billion - €60 billion euros in 2030. Moreover, as JPMorgan ( NYSE:JPM ) analyst Sandeep Deshpande points out, ASML Holding has a distinct advantage as the """"sole supplier"""" of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUL) tools for the microprocessor manufacturing industry. Clearly, this is an international niche-market mover that tech investors should put on their radars. What is the Price Target for ASML Stock? ASML has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on seven unanimous Buy ratings assigned in the past three months. The average ASML Holding stock price target of $686.60 implies 10.5% upside potential. Conclusion: Should You Consider International Stocks in 2023? Crescent Point Energy, International General Insurance Holdings, and ASML Holding are about as diverse as three companies can be. Yet, they all provide compelling reasons for prospective investors to think outside the box and take a chance on some interesting foreign businesses. All three of them pay dividends and offer growth potential for this year and the years to come. With this in mind, there's only one conclusion to make: international stocks are definitely worth looking into in 2023, and CPG, IGIC, and ASML could be big winners for open-minded financial traders.

"Risk and reward should be on every investor’s mind right now, and for good reason. The risks of market investing are piling up; according to Nadia Lovell, senior US equity strategist with UBS, we’re almost certain to see a recession hit this year. The chance of a hard downturn, in her view, is somewhat mitigated by a hot labor market and an excess in consumer savings ? but even so, Lovell believes that the S&amp;P 500 will drop to 3,700 this year before rebounding to 4,000 by year’s end. Lovell sees two drivers pushing the market into recession, pointing her finger at both a corporate earnings contraction and the rapid shift of the Federal Reserve to a policy of restrictive monetary tightening. “We think that there's more pain to come on the earnings side,” she says, and goes on to add, “It's going to be difficult for the economy to grow with such a massive change in the Fed Funds rate in 10 months. And so we find it difficult to see that we get earnings growth this year. And earnings are likely to contract at least 4%.” Adding additional grimness to that picture, Lovell is also predicting a higher unemployment rate, which she states is inevitable in a recessionary environment. Getting down to brass tacks, Lovell makes some specific sector recommendations for investors, to find the most attractive balance of risk and reward. She points to energy and healthcare stocks as solid choices, defensive plays that find wide endorsement among investment professionals. Energy stocks should do well as long as demand stays strong and supply limited, while healthcare stocks combine affordable valuations and sound growth potential. The stock analysts at UBS are taking Lovell’s evaluation as a starting point, and picking out individual stocks from these two sectors. We can dip into the TipRanks database for the latest details on some of these picks; here are two of them, with comments from the UBS analysts. OPAL Fuels Inc. ( OPAL) We’ll start in the energy sector, where OPAL Fuels is a leader in the renewable natural gas (RNG) segment. The company operates on both the production and distribution ends, capturing potentially harmful methane emissions and converting it into low-carbon-intensity RNG. The renewable fuel can be used to replace diesel and other fossil fuels. This company lists several ‘green economy’ advantages attributable to its RNG product, starting with savings in cost. Replacing diesel fuel with RNG can save transport fleet operators up to 50% in fuel costs every year. In addition, RNG production can be used to reduce methane emissions from landfills or dairy farms, and can be used to increase hydrogen production as another alternate fuel. OPAL is a newcomer to the public trading markets, having gone public in July of 2022 through a SPAC transaction, a business combination with ArcLight Clean Transition Corporation II. The transaction was approved on July 15, and the OPAL ticker started trading on July 22. In its most recent quarterly report, for 3Q22, OPAL showed a top line of $66.6 million, for a 41% year-over-year gain. This was derived from quarterly production of 0.6 million MMBtu of RNG, a y/y production increase of 50%; from sales of 7.4 million GGEs (gasoline gallon equivalents) of RNG, up 17% y/y; and deliveries of 30.7 million GGEs, which was up 33% from the prior year quarter. The company is guiding toward full-year 2022 RNG production of 2.2 million to 2.3 million MMBtu. OPAL is working to meet that goal by expanding its production capacity, and earlier this month the company announced the commencement of full operations at the first landfill gas to RNG facility in the state of Florida. The new facility is expected to produce up to 5 million GGEs per year going forward. In his coverage of OPAL for UBS, William Grippin highlights why investors should lean into this name right now. He writes, “We expect OPAL to grow adj. EBITDA by ~55% CAGR through 2026E, underpinned by a 4-yr construction backlog of renewable natural gas (RNG) projects. In our view, OPAL offers a favorable risk/reward skew with the current ~11x 2024 UBSe EV/EBITDA multiple not fully reflecting the growth potential of OPAL's project backlog. Key milestones over the next 12 months include: 1) On-time commissioning of 4 out of 7 currently in-construction projects, 2) conversion of 4-5 pipeline projects to in-construction status, 3) Establishment of final 2023 renewable fuel volume obligations by the EPA.” Looking forward from this stance, Grippin gives OPAL shares a Buy rating with a price target of $13 to indicate his confidence in ~86% upside on the one-year time frame. (To watch Grippin’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap RNG firm has picked up 5 recent reviews from the Street’s analysts and these are all positive, backing up a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is currently selling for $7 and its average price target, standing at $13.75, implies a robust 96% upside potential over the coming year. (See OPAL stock forecast ) Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. ( SRPT) For the second UBS pick we’ll switch to the healthcare sector. Sarepta is a biopharma company that has scored a ‘hat trick,’ having a comprehensive product and research lineup that features drug candidates in the discovery and clinical stages of development, as well as approved products in the commercialization stages. The company takes a gene editing approach to biopharmaceuticals, and is working on treatments for genetically-based disease conditions with a particular focus on muscular dystrophy. On the commercial side, Sarepta has three approved gene therapy products on the market for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. These three drugs, Exondys 51, Vyondys 53, and Amondys 45, brought in a total of $207.8 million in product revenues for 3Q22 - this was up 24% year-over-year, and made up the bulk of the company’s $230.3 million total top line. The additional revenues came from collaboration payments on pipeline drug candidates. The company also just released preliminary Q4 and full-year product revenue results; net product revenues for the quarter are expected to reach ~$235.5 million, amounting to a 32% y/y increase while revenues for the full-year are expected to reach $843.3 million, above guidance of $825 to $840 million. Turning to the pipeline, the most important program to note is SRP-9001 being developed together with Roche. This drug candidate is a potential treatment for ambulant patients with Duchenne; based on positive clinical trial results, the company this past September submitted the Biologics License Application to the FDA, and is seeking accelerated approval. A PDUFA date has been set for May 29. At the same time, Sarepta is also running the EMBARK clinical trial ? a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of SRP-9001, that is fully enrolled and dosed ? and has proposed this trial as a confirmatory study to support accelerated approval. Covering Sarepta for UBS is analyst Colin Bristow, who sees potential regulatory and clinical trial catalysts in the company’s late-stage research pipeline. Bristow says of Sarepta, “Our view is that accelerated approval for SRP-9001 in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) by the May 29 PDUFA is highly likely (we increased our Prob of Approval to 85% from 60%) - we believe SRPT has sufficient data to support the use of shortened/truncated dystrophin (formerly known as microdystrophin) expression as a surrogate biomarker of function. Additionally, the early involvement of CBER director Peter Marks and Neurology head Billy Dunn in the regulatory process are soft positive indicators of a favorable outcome, in our view (supported by our regulatory KOL discussion).” These comments fully support Bristow’s Buy rating on SRPT shares, and his $158 price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~31%. (To watch Bristow’s track record, click here) A healthcare stock with as many shots on goals as Sarepta ? the commercialized medications, the late-stage pipeline, the pre-clinical tracks ? is sure to attract investor and analyst interest, and SRPT shares have 17 recent reviews on file. These include 14 Buys and 3 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has an average price target of $148.88, suggesting ~25% upside from the current trading price of $120.13.

"There are no gains like biotech gains, a fact Biora Therapueutics ( BIOR ) investors can happily attest to following this week's market action. Shares of the micro-cap surged by over 200% after the company provided an encouraging update. Following a Type C meeting with the FDA regarding its PGN-600 Targeted Therapeutics program, which is focused on the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), the company said the regulatory body has provided positive feedback. And this means the company remains on course to file an IND (investigational new drug) application for the PGN-600 program, which will be followed by the initiation of clinical studies. Biora anticipates a trial will kick off in Q2, with data readouts expected in Q3. H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis is confident development will go according to plan. “Subsequent to the disclosure of positive FDA engagement and conversations with management, we believe the agency is becoming increasingly on board with the Targeted Therapeutics platform,” the analyst opined. “We remind investors that, while the Targeted Therapeutics employs a novel delivery device, the therapeutic payloads are well studied, validated, and safe. Biora's own independent investigations have further corroborated these observations. This due diligence, in our opinion, has helped build a compelling case to the FDA to move PGN-600 forward in a rapid manner.” The Targeted Therapeutics program makes use of a smart capsule that is ingested and designed to accurately deliver therapies to the gastrointestinal tract so to help with treating IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), with the company focused on ulcerative colitis to begin with. Biora also plans on presenting results from the program at the Crohn’s &amp; Colitis Congress this month (January 19-21). These will show successful function of the device when provided with food, which could “potentially allow non-fasted administration.” If you think you’re late for the party following this week's mighty gains, don’t fret. Pantginis gives Biora shares a $65 price target, suggesting the shares will deliver incredible upside of 879% over the coming year. (To watch Pantginis’ track record, click here ) This stock appears to be flying under Wall Street’s radar right now; Pantginis’ review is the sole one to be made over the past 3 months.

"""Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilized in multiple applications. From image recognition to healthcare, e-commerce to advertising to credit scoring and many other industries - all are making use of AI’s human-like capabilities. And with computing power continuously improving, it is set to get more prevalent over time. One recent example of its impact is ChatGPT ? the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched last November. The tool has quickly caught the public’s imagination with its ability to perform different tasks such as write articles, songs and even write code and its success has only highlighted how AI will keep on impacting our lives. Of course, with any fledgling industry, investors will get an opportunity to buy in and there are publicly traded companies basing their entire value proposition around AI. With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two AI-focused stocks that have the experts singing their praises. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices right now. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) The first AI stock we're looking at is SoundHound AI, a voice assisting specialist. Via speech, its voice AI platform enables consumers to interact with products. This is not some esoteric segment of the market we’re talking about. The company sees a huge TAM (total addressable market) of $160 billion ahead; by 2024, there are expected to be 8 billion voice assistants in use with 75 billion connected devices operating worldwide the following year. SoundHound has some big-name clients on its roster such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Stellantis and Vizio. SoundHound only became a public entity this year, entering the market via the SPAC route back in April. It has been a trial by fire, to say the least. The shares are down by 88% since the debut as SPACs went seriously out of favor in 2022’s bear. Nevertheless, despite worries about the company being able to withstand the tough macro conditions amidst continued losses, it has been posting some impressive growth. In Q3, revenue climbed by 178% YoY to $11.2 million. The company saw a cumulative bookings backlog of $302 million, amounting to a 239% YoY increase - representing a fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth and a company record. In November, the company introduced a new product called Dynamic Interaction, a conversational AI tool that enables businesses to use voice AI technology when servicing customers. Cantor’s Brett Knoblauch thinks it could be a “game-changing technology as it pertains to how humans interact with computers, and more broadly speaking, technology.” “We believe there are numerous use-cases that this technology could be utilized for, with low-hanging fruit being within customer-service settings like restaurants,” the analyst went on to add. “We believe this product 1) further expands upon SOUN's conversational AI advantage; 2) gives us greater visibility into SOUN's revenue trajectory; 3) will accelerate the mix-shift of revenue towards subscription revenue; and 4) expands SOUN's addressable market.” Conveying his confidence, Knoblauch rates SOUN as Overweight (i.e., Buy) and backs it up with a $1.60 price target, implying shares will move ~32% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Knoblauch’s track record, click here) Knoblauch, while bullish on the stock, is somewhat conservative compared to the general Wall Street view here. The average price target is higher than Alexanders, at $3.70, implying a strong upside potential of ~206% from the $1.21 share price. Unsurprisingly, SOUN has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a unanimous 3 Buys. (See SOUN stock forecast ) Perfect Corp ( PERF ) The next AI stock we’ll look at is Perfect Corp, essentially a SaaS company with a twist. The unique selling point is that it offers augmented reality and artificial solutions to the fashion and beauty sectors. So, how does that work? With the use of facial 3D modelling and deep learning tech, the company’s AI/AR makeup and hair solutions allow users to try on makeup and different hairstyles and dyes digitally. Basically, AI-powered virtual try-on offerings. In a world where so much is shifting online and consumers expect engaging experiences catered to their own style, the company is an early mover with a market leading position in this niche. Formed in 2015, some of the world’s most famous cosmetics companies are already on board; Estee Lauder Group, Coty, Kose, LVMH, and Shiseido are all using the solutions. The company has only been on the public markets since the end of last October when it IPOd via the SPAC route; at the end of November, Perfect announced unaudited financial results for the nine months of the year. Driven by an uptick in AR/AI cloud solutions and subscription revenues, total revenue increased by 22.1% year-over-year to $36.2 million, while gross profit rose from $25.6 million in the same period a year ago to $31.1 million. Even better, net income swung dramatically from a net loss of $3.1 million a year ago to $28.5 million. For Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz, that is just one of the reasons that makes Perfect an appealing investment choice. """"The business is a proven disruptor of the beauty industry, has achieved scale, and is profitably growing at a fast rate,"""" the 5-star analyst said. “We think the pedigree, technology vision, strong culture, and industry experience of its CEO and leadership team will set the company up to be a vertical SaaS leader and become a good compounding growth investment… The beauty and fashion markets for AI/AR solutions are early in evolution; PERF is arguably the best growth asset in the categories for investment.” Accordingly, Schwartz rates PERF shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $10 price target implies 12-month growth of ~25%. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, PERF gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""In this piece, I compared two nuclear energy stocks -- SMR and LEU to see which is better. The energy crisis in Europe triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing many ESG-focused investors to rethink their energy stock investments. Traditionally, fossil fuels and nuclear energy were off the table for those with environmental, social, and governance concerns. However, nuclear energy is now looking attractive to some for its zero-carbon nature. NuScale Power Corp ( NYSE:SMR ) and Centrus Energy Corp ( NYSE MKT:LEU ) attack the nuclear energy question in two different ways. NuScale is building small modular nuclear reactors, while Centrus focuses on high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEAU). Upon closer analysis, it looks like SMR stock may be a better bet. Let's see why. SMR (red) vs. LEU (green) stock chart NuScale Power (SMR) On the one hand, NuScale Power is pretty much trading near the bottom of its all-time range. It went public at around $10 a share via a SPAC merger in December 2020, and it has since erased almost all the gains it enjoyed in 2022. On the other hand, NuScale is unprofitable with very little revenue yet. A deeper dive suggests a bullish view might look appropriate ? with the caveat that this is a high-risk name. Despite trading at the ground floor of where it went public via its SPAC merger, NuScale's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is outrageous, at around 54 times. The company is unprofitable yet, having recorded only 2.9 million in revenue for 2021. However, its revenue exploded in the last 12 months to $10 million, suggesting the potential for powerful growth in the near term. In 2022, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified the design for NuScale's new reactor, a massive win for the company as the commission hasn't certified any designs in years. The company's reactors differ from other nuclear reactors because they are much smaller than the massive, site-specific nuclear plants in use by utilities for decades. NuScale's design is also the first design ever to be approved for an advanced nuclear reactor in the U.S. Additionally, the company entered into an agreement last year with a South Korean industrial firm to forge materials for its small modular reactors. Finally, NuScale has a positive book value per share, at $2.42/share, which is more than can be said for Centrus. Also, NuScale has no debt despite its lack of revenue. In fact, it had $318.6 million in cash and equivalents as of the most recent quarter and only $84.8 million in total liabilities. What is the Price Target for SMR Stock? NuScale Power has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $13, the average price target for NuScale Power stock implies upside potential of 23.93%. Centrus Energy (LEU) Centrus Energy is much more established, having a publicly-traded history dating back to 1998. The stock is up 11% already for 2023 and has gained 29% for the last six months. Its high debt suggests a neutral view might be appropriate. Centrus offers a different way to play the uranium market. Last month, the company signed a contract with the Department of Energy to produce HALEU, which is uranium that's been enriched to a higher concentration than the uranium used to fuel the current fleet of light water reactors. HALEU is expected to power next-generation reactors. One concern is Centrus' negative price/book value per share (-$6.92/share), which indicates balance sheet insolvency because its liabilities outweigh its assets. While it doesn't necessarily mean the company is a bad investment, it does make it extremely risky. On its balance sheet, Centrus had $131.7 million in cash and equivalents, $618.2 million in total assets, and $718.5 million in total liabilities as of its most recent quarter. However, Centrus' P/S ratio of 2.1 and P/E ratio of 4.7 look attractive relative to the recent run-up in nuclear energy stocks. Despite having been around for decades, the company still had """"only"""" $256.6 million in revenue for the last 12 months, although it is turning a profit, generating $147.1 million in net income for the last 12 months. What is the Price Target for LEU Stock? Centrus Energy has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on two Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $60.50, the average price target for Centrus Energy stock implies upside potential of 53.9%. Conclusion: Bullish on SMR, Neutral on LEU Both companies are speculative, so Centrus could have just as bright of a future as NuScale, or NuScale could flop while Centrus soars. For now, though, Centrus' debt is a critical concern. Ultimately, investors interested in nuclear energy stocks may want to weigh the good and bad for themselves and choose which one looks better to them. Disclosure""",1,호재
"While the overall stock market direction so far this year remains up, the path ahead still presents plenty of potential headwinds. Inflation has yet to be properly tamed, the geopolitical map remains uncertain with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine still ongoing and Covid variants could reappear at any time. Add in the prospect for a fiery battle in Congress around raising the debt ceiling, and Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus thinks market volatility is “unlikely to leave the landscape.” However, these should not act as deterrents for stock investing, with Stoltzfus noting “there never is ‘an all clear signal’ sounded over the markets.” “Experience tells us that with opportunity comes risk and with risk comes opportunity whether in everyday life, businesses on Main Street, or in the Canyons of Wall Street,” he went to say, before championing “diversification.” With that idea in mind, let’s take a look at two stocks that Stoltzfus’ analyst colleagues at the banking firm believe make sound investment choices right now. In fact, one of them, according to the analysts, could surge as much as 170% over the next 12 months. Let's take a closer look. Icosavax, Inc. ( ICVX) The first name we’ll look at is Icosavax, a research-oriented biotech company working on new classes of vaccines using virus-like particles, with the aim of protecting older adults from respiratory viruses. The company is now at the clinical trial stage, with four research tracks in progress, two at the Phase 1 stage and two more in pre-clinical stages. Icosavax’s most advanced pipeline candidate, IVX-121, is under investigation as a vaccine for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is currently at the Phase 1b stage, and the data released so far has been encouraging. The second advanced program is the Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12, a combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate developed through the fusion of IVX-121 with the company’s older drug candidate, IVX-241. The Phase 1 trial should have a topline data readout in the middle of the year. A Phase 2 trial of this candidate is planned for initiation in 2H23. Icosavax is pre-revenue, as it does not yet have a product on the market or partnership agreements with other drug companies. On the financial side, however, the company does have resources to lean on ? in its last financial report, for 3Q22, the company had $222.5 million in cash on hand, enough to fund operations into 2024. Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Hartaj Singh follows this stock, and he takes an upbeat stance on this vax developer’s path. Singh writes: “We believe that the company has a differentiated vaccine platform, utilizing virus-line particles (VLPs) to manufacture and test vaccines against respiratory pathogens in humans. This scalable platform can help produce differentiated vaccines with a robust risk/benefit profile and durable immunogenicity… The company exits 2022 with robust Phase 1 data in RSV, and with 6-month durability. In 2023, we expect proof-of-concept (PoC) in bivalent RSV/hMPV and 12-month RSV data. We are bullish.” Bullish, indeed. Going forward from this position, Singh rates Icosavax shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a price target of $27 to suggest a robust 170% upside potential in the coming year. (To watch Singh’s track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap biotech has picked up 5 recent analyst reviews ? and they are unanimously positive, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See ICVX stock forecast ) Toll Brothers, Inc. ( TOL) Next up is Toll Brothers, a Fortune 500 company in the construction industry. Toll Brothers designs, builds, markets, and finances residential and commercial properties in the US. The company is one of the largest such firms operating in the US real estate and construction industry, and is one of the top-five home builders in the US. Persistently high inflation, and the Fed’s increased interest rates in response, have put heavy pressure on the real estate and construction sector, and TOL shares finished a rocky 2022 with a 30% annual loss. However, the shares have been on the up in recent months boosted by strong FQ4 (October quarter) results, in which the company beat expectations. Toll reported a bottom-line EPS of $5.63, beating the analyst forecast of $3.94 by a wide margin ? and growing 86% year-over-year. At the top line, the company had revenues of $3.71 billion, a solid $500 million above the consensus estimate, and up 22% from fiscal 4Q21. Two conflicting metrics will show how the current environment remains difficult to navigate. The company’s backlog of homes had, as of the end of fiscal 2022, an average price of $1.095 million, up from $922,100 at the end of the prior fiscal year. Higher prices can help to offset lower demand ? but demand is dropping quickly, as evidenced by a Q4 y/y spike in cancellations as a percentage of signed contracts, from 4.6% to 20.8%. It remains to be seen which metric ? higher prices or falling demand ? will predominate going forward. Putting these metrics aside, according to Oppenheimer analyst Tyler Batory, Toll shares are trading at 'compelling valuation levels.' “We see less downside risk to gross margin than with other builders given its to-be-built business model and backlog. These factors should also allow the company to be patient in terms of managing its pace and price in FY23. We also think the company should get credit for having the best balance sheet and leverage profile in its history. With shares trading at 0.92x consensus FY23E BVPS (book value per share), we think the risk/reward is attractive,” Batory opined. In Batory’s view, TOL deserves an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his price target of $71 implies a one-year upside potential of 24%. (To watch Batory’s track record, click here) With 9 recent analyst reviews on file, breaking down to 6 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell, this stock holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""Artificial intelligence (AI) is already being utilized in multiple applications. From image recognition to healthcare, e-commerce to advertising to credit scoring and many other industries - all are making use of AI’s human-like capabilities. And with computing power continuously improving, it is set to get more prevalent over time. One recent example of its impact is ChatGPT ? the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched last November. The tool has quickly caught the public’s imagination with its ability to perform different tasks such as write articles, songs and even write code and its success has only highlighted how AI will keep on impacting our lives. Of course, with any fledgling industry, investors will get an opportunity to buy in and there are publicly traded companies basing their entire value proposition around AI. With this in mind, we delved into the TipRanks database and pulled out two AI-focused stocks that have the experts singing their praises. Let’s see what makes them appealing investment choices right now. SoundHound AI ( SOUN ) The first AI stock we're looking at is SoundHound AI, a voice assisting specialist. Via speech, its voice AI platform enables consumers to interact with products. This is not some esoteric segment of the market we’re talking about. The company sees a huge TAM (total addressable market) of $160 billion ahead; by 2024, there are expected to be 8 billion voice assistants in use with 75 billion connected devices operating worldwide the following year. SoundHound has some big-name clients on its roster such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Deutsche Telekom, Snap, Stellantis and Vizio. SoundHound only became a public entity this year, entering the market via the SPAC route back in April. It has been a trial by fire, to say the least. The shares are down by 88% since the debut as SPACs went seriously out of favor in 2022’s bear. Nevertheless, despite worries about the company being able to withstand the tough macro conditions amidst continued losses, it has been posting some impressive growth. In Q3, revenue climbed by 178% YoY to $11.2 million. The company saw a cumulative bookings backlog of $302 million, amounting to a 239% YoY increase - representing a fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth and a company record. In November, the company introduced a new product called Dynamic Interaction, a conversational AI tool that enables businesses to use voice AI technology when servicing customers. Cantor’s Brett Knoblauch thinks it could be a “game-changing technology as it pertains to how humans interact with computers, and more broadly speaking, technology.” “We believe there are numerous use-cases that this technology could be utilized for, with low-hanging fruit being within customer-service settings like restaurants,” the analyst went on to add. “We believe this product 1) further expands upon SOUN's conversational AI advantage; 2) gives us greater visibility into SOUN's revenue trajectory; 3) will accelerate the mix-shift of revenue towards subscription revenue; and 4) expands SOUN's addressable market.” Conveying his confidence, Knoblauch rates SOUN as Overweight (i.e., Buy) and backs it up with a $1.60 price target, implying shares will move ~32% higher over the one-year timeframe. (To watch Knoblauch’s track record, click here) Knoblauch, while bullish on the stock, is somewhat conservative compared to the general Wall Street view here. The average price target is higher than Alexanders, at $3.70, implying a strong upside potential of ~206% from the $1.21 share price. Unsurprisingly, SOUN has a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on a unanimous 3 Buys. (See SOUN stock forecast ) Perfect Corp ( PERF ) The next AI stock we’ll look at is Perfect Corp, essentially a SaaS company with a twist. The unique selling point is that it offers augmented reality and artificial solutions to the fashion and beauty sectors. So, how does that work? With the use of facial 3D modelling and deep learning tech, the company’s AI/AR makeup and hair solutions allow users to try on makeup and different hairstyles and dyes digitally. Basically, AI-powered virtual try-on offerings. In a world where so much is shifting online and consumers expect engaging experiences catered to their own style, the company is an early mover with a market leading position in this niche. Formed in 2015, some of the world’s most famous cosmetics companies are already on board; Estee Lauder Group, Coty, Kose, LVMH, and Shiseido are all using the solutions. The company has only been on the public markets since the end of last October when it IPOd via the SPAC route; at the end of November, Perfect announced unaudited financial results for the nine months of the year. Driven by an uptick in AR/AI cloud solutions and subscription revenues, total revenue increased by 22.1% year-over-year to $36.2 million, while gross profit rose from $25.6 million in the same period a year ago to $31.1 million. Even better, net income swung dramatically from a net loss of $3.1 million a year ago to $28.5 million. For Oppenheimer analyst Brian Schwartz, that is just one of the reasons that makes Perfect an appealing investment choice. """"The business is a proven disruptor of the beauty industry, has achieved scale, and is profitably growing at a fast rate,"""" the 5-star analyst said. “We think the pedigree, technology vision, strong culture, and industry experience of its CEO and leadership team will set the company up to be a vertical SaaS leader and become a good compounding growth investment… The beauty and fashion markets for AI/AR solutions are early in evolution; PERF is arguably the best growth asset in the categories for investment.” Accordingly, Schwartz rates PERF shares an Outperform (i.e., Buy), while his $10 price target implies 12-month growth of ~25%. (To watch Schwartz’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 1 Buy and 2 Holds have been published in the last three months. As a result, PERF gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating.

"""In this piece, I compared two nuclear energy stocks -- SMR and LEU to see which is better. The energy crisis in Europe triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is causing many ESG-focused investors to rethink their energy stock investments. Traditionally, fossil fuels and nuclear energy were off the table for those with environmental, social, and governance concerns. However, nuclear energy is now looking attractive to some for its zero-carbon nature. NuScale Power Corp ( NYSE:SMR ) and Centrus Energy Corp ( NYSE MKT:LEU ) attack the nuclear energy question in two different ways. NuScale is building small modular nuclear reactors, while Centrus focuses on high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEAU). Upon closer analysis, it looks like SMR stock may be a better bet. Let's see why. SMR (red) vs. LEU (green) stock chart NuScale Power (SMR) On the one hand, NuScale Power is pretty much trading near the bottom of its all-time range. It went public at around $10 a share via a SPAC merger in December 2020, and it has since erased almost all the gains it enjoyed in 2022. On the other hand, NuScale is unprofitable with very little revenue yet. A deeper dive suggests a bullish view might look appropriate ? with the caveat that this is a high-risk name. Despite trading at the ground floor of where it went public via its SPAC merger, NuScale's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple is outrageous, at around 54 times. The company is unprofitable yet, having recorded only 2.9 million in revenue for 2021. However, its revenue exploded in the last 12 months to $10 million, suggesting the potential for powerful growth in the near term. In 2022, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified the design for NuScale's new reactor, a massive win for the company as the commission hasn't certified any designs in years. The company's reactors differ from other nuclear reactors because they are much smaller than the massive, site-specific nuclear plants in use by utilities for decades. NuScale's design is also the first design ever to be approved for an advanced nuclear reactor in the U.S. Additionally, the company entered into an agreement last year with a South Korean industrial firm to forge materials for its small modular reactors. Finally, NuScale has a positive book value per share, at $2.42/share, which is more than can be said for Centrus. Also, NuScale has no debt despite its lack of revenue. In fact, it had $318.6 million in cash and equivalents as of the most recent quarter and only $84.8 million in total liabilities. What is the Price Target for SMR Stock? NuScale Power has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $13, the average price target for NuScale Power stock implies upside potential of 23.93%. Centrus Energy (LEU) Centrus Energy is much more established, having a publicly-traded history dating back to 1998. The stock is up 11% already for 2023 and has gained 29% for the last six months. Its high debt suggests a neutral view might be appropriate. Centrus offers a different way to play the uranium market. Last month, the company signed a contract with the Department of Energy to produce HALEU, which is uranium that's been enriched to a higher concentration than the uranium used to fuel the current fleet of light water reactors. HALEU is expected to power next-generation reactors. One concern is Centrus' negative price/book value per share (-$6.92/share), which indicates balance sheet insolvency because its liabilities outweigh its assets. While it doesn't necessarily mean the company is a bad investment, it does make it extremely risky. On its balance sheet, Centrus had $131.7 million in cash and equivalents, $618.2 million in total assets, and $718.5 million in total liabilities as of its most recent quarter. However, Centrus' P/S ratio of 2.1 and P/E ratio of 4.7 look attractive relative to the recent run-up in nuclear energy stocks. Despite having been around for decades, the company still had """"only"""" $256.6 million in revenue for the last 12 months, although it is turning a profit, generating $147.1 million in net income for the last 12 months. What is the Price Target for LEU Stock? Centrus Energy has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on two Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $60.50, the average price target for Centrus Energy stock implies upside potential of 53.9%. Conclusion: Bullish on SMR, Neutral on LEU Both companies are speculative, so Centrus could have just as bright of a future as NuScale, or NuScale could flop while Centrus soars. For now, though, Centrus' debt is a critical concern. Ultimately, investors interested in nuclear energy stocks may want to weigh the good and bad for themselves and choose which one looks better to them. Disclosure""",1,호재

"Investor sentiment has been improving, but the contrarians haven’t gone silent. Legendary British investor Jeremy Grantham is predicting hard times ahead, as he lays out his case for doom and gloom to cast a shadow on the markets. In Grantham’s view, the pandemic stock gains were a bubble, and that bubble hasn’t fully popped yet. Putting some numbers to this view, Grantham believes that a further drop of 20% is possible this year ? and in his worst-case scenario, he says that the S&amp;P 500 could collapse as much as 50% from current levels. Backing his view, Grantham says of that worst case, “Even the direst case of a 50% decline from here would leave us at just under 2,000 on the S&amp;P, or about 37% cheap. To put this in perspective, it would still be a far smaller percent deviation from trendline value than the overpricing we had at the end of 2021 of over 70%. So you shouldn't be tempted to think it absolutely cannot happen.” So, what is an investor to do with all this doom and gloom talk? Well, it should prompt a natural turn toward defensive stocks, and especially to the high-yield dividend payers. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to pull the details on two such equities that offer a market beating dividend yield of at least 8% and a Strong Buy rating from the analyst community. Let's dive in. CTO Realty Growth, Inc. ( CTO) We’ll start with a real estate investment trust (REIT), as these companies have long been known as dividend champions. CTO Realty Growth operates in nine states, including such major growth areas as Florida and Texas, and manages a portfolio of income-generating properties in the shopping mall and retail niches. Most of the company’s real estate assets are in the Southeast and Southwest regions. CTO also maintains a 15% interest in another REIT, Alpine Income Property Trust. CTO Realty has shown some mixed trends in revenue and income over the past 12 months, which can be seen in the last quarterly report, from 3Q22. At the top line, the total revenue of $23.1 million was up 40% year-over-year, while the bottom line net income attributable to the company fell almost 80%, from $23.9 million to $4.8 million over the same period. During that time however, CTO shares have been outperforming the overall stock market; the S&amp;P 500 is down more than 7% over the last 12 months, while CTO is up 7%. The company will release its 4Q22 results, and its full-year 2022 results, on February 23, less than a month from now. We’ll see then how the trend lines are holding on revenues and earnings. On the dividend front, CTO has been consistently strong. The company has been raising the quarterly common share payment gradually since the first quarter of last year. On an annualized basis, the dividend pays $1.52 per common share ? and is yielding a solid 8%. This beats inflation by 1.5 points, ensuring a real rate of return. But more importantly, the company pays out reliably ? it’s history of keeping up dividend payments stretches back to the 1970s. BTIG analyst Michael Gorman, in his recent note on real estate investment trusts, revised his top pick in the niche ? and named CTO Realty. “We think CTO should be able to invest accretively in the coming quarters given its ability to monetize its free-standing properties as well as the unique access to ‘other assets’ on the balance sheet. By virtue of CTO’s $17M of subsurface interests and mitigation credits, the $46M structured investments portfolio, and the value of its common stock ownership and management agreement with Alpine Income Property Trust, we think the company has more levers for growth available relative to the majority of our REIT coverage,” Gorman opined. Looking ahead from here, Gorman rates CTO shares a Buy, and his price target of $21 implies a one-year upside potential of 11%. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has 19% potential total return profile. (To watch Gorman’s track record, click here) What does the rest of the Street think about CTO's long-term growth prospects? It turns out that other analysts agree with Gorman. The stock received 4 Buys in the last three months compared to no Holds or Sells, making the consensus rating a Strong Buy. (See CTO stock forecast ) Dynex Capital, Inc. ( DX) Sticking with REIT’s, well turn to the mortgage-backed security niche. Dynex Capital focuses on mortgage loans and securities, investing in these instruments on a leveraged basis. The company’s approach to portfolio development is based on several simple rules, including capital preservation, disciplined capital allocation, and stable returns on the long term. From an investor perspective, those returns include a high-yield dividend, paid out monthly. The most recent payment was declared earlier this month for a February 1 payment at 13 cents per common share. This payment annualizes to $1.56, and gives a yield of 10.8%. The company’s history of reliable payments goes back to 2008, a clear positive for investors to consider. And with inflation still running at 6.5% annualized, the attractions of Dynex Capital’s steady, high-yield payment are clear. Dynex’s operations brought in a total interest income of $20.4 million, as of 3Q22. This compares favorably to the previous quarter’s total of $18.3 million ? although it is down significantly from the $56.1 million reported for 3Q21. Over that same time period, Dynex saw its net income to common shareholders switch from $91.4 million to a loss of $42.5 million. The net loss reflects a sharp decline in the company’s book value, which management attributed to increasing domestic interest rates combined with a difficult geopolitical situation. However, the company's liquidity remains solid. Supporting the dividend, the company reported a non-GAAP earnings available for distribution (EAD) of 24 cents per common share, and had cash holdings of $260.3 million. Even though DX is facing headwinds, Credit Suisse 5-star analyst Douglas Harter recently upgraded his rating on the stock from Neutral to Outperform (i.e. Buy). Backing his bullish stance, Harter writes: “We view the stock as the most attractive among the Agency-focused mREITs to capture potential tightening of MBS spreads. This is based on a higher level of confidence in the sustainability of the dividend (lowest required yield among Agency-focused), attractive P/B valuation (87% of book compared to 97% for other Agency-focused peers), and a stronger relative track record of protecting book value in volatile period.” (To watch Harter’s track record, click here .) Overall, this REIT has picked up 3 analyst reviews recently, and they are all positive and give the stock its unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.
